This is skill in fighting in close range either unarmed or with melee weapons.

Different basic attacks can be performed while unarmed 
**Deal damage**(attempt to kill)
The attack deals 1D3+1 damage, usually this is much more violent than just a punch to the head.
When a melee weapon is used its damage replaces the standart damage.

**Supress/Recover**
You opponent gains a -1 modifier on all actions or your negative modifier ges reduced by 1 depending on who is in control.
This value loses any meaning once the combatants disengage.
