====== DiceRolls ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

Uses D20 to roll on abilities. Rolling over the ability value means failure. Rolls may be modified:

Easy Task			: Roll 3 D20 and take the lowest
Normal Task			: Roll 2 D20 and take the lowest
Hard/Risky Task		: Roll 1D20
Very Hard Task 		: Roll 2D20 take the highest
Basically Impossible     : Roll 3D20 take the highest

Easier than easy means an automatic 1 roll is assumed, like hitting a barn with a rifle. From within the barn.

Harder than basically impossible is only impossible which assumes an automatic 20 roll.

**Duel:** In a skill duel each participant rolls as usual(usually **Normal** difficulty) and notes the difference Skill level - Roll. The highest value wins.
