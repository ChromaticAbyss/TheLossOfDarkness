Created Sunday 28 June 2015
Combat in this system is designed to be extremely deadly. Going in on a fight against enemies that commonly have a similar level of competence to the player characters can prove deadly extremely fast without a proper layering of survival strategies.
Its less about rolling a lot of dice and using your high stats and more about squeezing every single advantage you can get out of the system. 



Order of combatants:
To make managing them as easy as possible all allied combatants are grouped. Which group goes first is determined by who has the leader with the highest tactics ability(prerequisite: A plan was actually made and its not an ambush etc).
Usually a combat starts with the longest range weapon being just in range while the other need to close the gap first, certain setups(i.e. indoors) might make this irrelevant tough.

Each character has one Action and one Move per turn by default.

**Action**:	Attack(Melee weapon or throwing weapon) 
		 Attack with your melee weapon by making a duel: Hand to Hand(normal) vs Reflexes(normal). If you win the duel roll damage for your weapon and apply it.
		Using a weapon you are not used to makes your part of the duel a **hard** roll, being surrounded by at least 3 enemies without any allies nearby makes the defense a **hard** roll.
	
**Action**:	Attack(Ranged weapon) 
		 Attack with your melee weapon by making a duel: Shooting(normal) vs Cover. Keep in mind that the cover roll is done once 
		 If you win the duel roll damage for your weapon and apply it.
		Using a weapon you are not used to makes your part of the duel a **hard** roll.

**Action:** Reload(mostly ranged weapons)
		  Reload your ranged weapons magazines, to do so fast and without jamming your weapon you must pass a Shooting(easy) check(this can be ignored with a specialisation of shooting).
		The check my be **normal** or even **hard** for weapons you are not used to / don't know.


**Move:** Normal Move
	  Move up to 3 metres. If you intend to traverse an obstacle you may need to roll a check on the respective ability.

**Move+Action**: Sprint
	 Move up to 6 metres.  If you intend to traverse an obstacle you may need to roll a check on the respective ability, this check is one category **harder** than usual.

**Action**: Take cover 
Assume a covered position that still allows participation in combat. Roll a  Cover(normal) check to see what quality of cover you find/ how well you use it. Very open terrain may have a maximum achievable cover value.
On moving the Cover is usually lost.
