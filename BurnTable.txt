====== BurnTable ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

A BurnTable is a table of bad things that can happen on a failed Cast check. It has 20 entries and is by default filled with:

1 Consume: You take a tenth of your [[Glow]] amount as damage to your Stability.

20 Sting: You take a tenth of you [[Glow]] amount as damage to your Vitality.

As the characters aquire Bindings they will most likely gain entries in their [[BurnTable]] that will increase the potential for side effects that fit with the Binding they aquired.
Note: Its completely possible that side effects of different types stack in a field.
