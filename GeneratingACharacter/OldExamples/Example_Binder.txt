====== Example Binder ======
Created Tuesday 07 July 2015

The child of a shaman of the wastes, at least thats what he says about himself.

**Notes:** The goal is to have quite a few bindings even beyond the starting ones. We should also look that the mutations and burn table entries stay low.

leaves 1 point, now to the bindings

=== Binding Rolls [Crystalline]: ===
(Willpower + Binding-ability)/2 is 7
Maximum Stability is 15 so we  have 8 tries to nail this.
Easy(7) 11 3 - success

**Mutation rolls**
Binding-ability + (Resistance /2) = 8
**Cristallized Skin**: easy(8+3) 10 - -  success

**Cristalline Keratin:** easy(8+3) 4 - -  success

**Burn Table rolls:** 
Binding-ability is 7

**Crystalline Stasis** easy(7) 4 - - success

**Crystalline Reflections **easy(7) 9 16 2 success

**Crystalline Memory **easy(7) 9 2 - success

we took neither mutations nor burn table entries which is very good for us.

=== Binding Rolls [Spectrum]: ===
(Willpower + Binding-ability)/2 is 7
Maximum Stability is 15 so we  have 8 tries to nail this.
Easy(7) 10 10 8 fail
Easy(8) 7 - -  success

**Mutation rolls**
Binding-ability + (Resistance /2) = 8

**Odd Eye Colour/Form** easy(8+5) 16 2 - success

**Chromatic Confusion** easy(8+5) 5 - - success

**Burn Table rolls:** 
Binding-ability is 7

**Spectral illumination** easy(7) 11 2 - success

**Spectral overflow:** easy(7) 5 - success

Once more we took neither mutations nor burn table entries which is very good for us.

=== Binding Rolls [Consuming]: ===
(Willpower + Binding-ability)/2 is 7
Maximum Stability is 15 so we  have 8 tries to nail this.
Easy(7) 7 - - success

**Mutation rolls**
Binding-ability + (Resistance /2) = 8

**Sharp Teeth** easy(8+5) 4 - - success

**Constant Hunger** easy(8+0) 20 12 12 fail
		- Another binge eater to compete with the Hunter archetype
		
**Fat:** easy(8+7) 5 - - success

**Unhingable Jaw:** easy(8+3) 18 6 - success

**Cannibal:** very easy(8+4) auto success

**Burn Table rolls:** 
Binding-ability is 7

**Hunger** easy(8+0) 4 - - success

**Feeding on the host** easy(8+0) 7 - - success

We take a total of one Mutation and 0 Burn Table entries generating a powerful and very versatile caster. The risk of stacking a ton of [[Glow]] is basically nonexistant so that this character can focus on mastering the Bindings he has and does not have to invest into Cast very soon.
Hes also reasonably equipped for aquiring more bindings in the future both due to his great skill and the almost complete lack of sideeffects.
He had to pay a hefty 60 points for the three bindings at character generation but the fact that he got basically no downside from them should make up for that cost easily.
