====== Example Caster(Trickster) ======
Created Tuesday 07 July 2015

The Difference from this guy to the example Binder is the extreme specialization on one binding: The trickster
Its abilities will be used at every possible occasion without much respect to the [[Glow]] buildup.
We won't put points in Binding since background wise the Binding occured naturally unlike with the Binder example character.

We keep a few PP to upgrade our Binding after rolling it.


=== Binding Rolls [Consuming]: ===
**Stability rolls**(maximum is 15 so we have 8 rolls to nail this): 
(Willpower + Binding-ability)/2 is 0
1. Easy(1) 19 9 8 fail
2. Easy(2) 8 2 - success

**Mutation rolls**
Binding-ability + (Resistance /2) = 0

**Split tongue**: easy(+5) 3 - - success
	→ Mutation does not apply 

**Burn Table rolls:** 
Binding-ability is 0

**Dancing illumination: **easy(+0) 17, 13, 8, missing 8 so we take the maximum of 5 entries of Dancing Illumination
Position roll: 5 so we enter this effect from 5 to9

**Distracting Presence: **easy(+0) 7 8 1, with a giant strike of luck we take only 1 entry of Distracting Presence
Position Roll: 1 so we enter this effect at 3

**Unnerving Presence: **easy(+7) 6 - -  success

We take no mutation and only 6 burn table entries(5 of which are rather harmless) thanks to nice rolls.

Final burn table: 
1 Consume: You take a tenth of your Glow amount as damage to your Stability
2 
3 
4 **Distracting Presence**
5 **Dancing illumination**
6 **Dancing illumination**
7  **Dancing illumination**
8  **Dancing illumination**
9  **Dancing illumination**

20 Sting: You take a tenth of you Glow amount as damage to your Vitality

Since this table is so harmless we don't even need to increase our Cast skill, 6 is a pretty decent value. Spamming abilities will definitly be doable.

Now with that in mind lets spend the res tof the points(22):
Binding Mastery(Trickster) 5 → 6			6
Trickster: Dazzle							6
Trickster: Magic Trick						2
Trickster: Tricksters Contract 				7
so we start with all the cool abilities(or at least their base versions)

Leaves 1 point open
