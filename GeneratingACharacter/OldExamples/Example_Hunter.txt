=== Binding Rolls [Consuming]: ===
**Stability rolls**(maximum is 15 so we have 8 rolls to nail this): 
(Willpower + Binding-ability)/2 is 0
Rolls are by default Normal(+0) so it becomes easy(+0) 
1. Auto fail 
2. Easy(1): 10 16 6 fail
3. Easy(2): 11 20 16 fail
4. Easy(3): 17 5 7 fail
5. Easy(4): 15 12 7 fail
6. Easy(5): 5- - success
so we don't take any permanent stability loss for this character

**Mutation rolls**
Binding-ability + (Resistance /2) = 2
Sharp teeth roll: Easy(2+5) 1 - - success
	→ Mutation does not apply
	
Constant Hunger roll : Easy(2) 18 14 12 fail
	→ This character has the **constant hunger** mutation. Further mutation checks have +5
	
Fat: Easy(7+2+5): 11 - - success
	→ Mutation does not apply 

Unhingable Jaw: Easy(3+2+5): 9 - - success
	→ Mutation does not apply 

Cannibal: Very Easy(>1) auto success due to automatic 1 roll.
	→ Mutation does not apply 


**Burn Table rolls:** 
Binding-ability is 0

Hunger: Easy(0) 4 6 19, **we miss 4** points so we take 4 burn table entries of "Hunger".
Rolling for the position: 15 so from 15 to 19 we enter "Hunger(Consuming Binding)"

Feeding on the host: Easy(0) 1 8 9, **we miss only 1** point so we take 1 burn table entry of "feeding on the host". 
Rolling for the position: 2 so on 2 we enter "Feeding On the Host(Consuming Binding)"


Final burn table: 
1 Consume: You take a tenth of your Glow amount as damage to your Stability.
2 Feeding On The Host(Consuming Binding)

20 Sting: You take a tenth of you Glow amount as damage to your Vitality.

which is definitely okay for a non casting focussed character.

Our mutations are: **Constant Hunger**: The character requires twice the normal food intake for basic functioning.
This is not too bad because we can sustain ourselves in the wilderness. It might be hurtful to our upkeep of Gluttony stacks in urban enviournments tough.
