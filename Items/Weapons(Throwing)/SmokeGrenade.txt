Creates a 10 metre radius zone of thick smoke. 
Usually lasts for about 2 minutes but the smoke field may dissipate quickly in strong wind and linger longer in an enclosed space.
Shots into the shroud are basically randomized unless the shooter can see through it with x ray vision (infrared does not work).
The smoke is also very good at absorbing/scattering lasers which lose 2 points of damage for every metre of smoke they have to penetrate.


=== Variants and Modifications ===
**Self made smoke bomb**: Takes 1 turn of combat for the smoke to build up. Laser weapon strength reduction only 1 point per metre.
