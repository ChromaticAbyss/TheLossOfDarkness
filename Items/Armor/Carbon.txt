====== Carbon ======
Created Saturday 08 August 2015

This marvel of technology is as light as a leather armor and can stop bullets as well as steel can. The major downside aside form the price is that carbon tends to splinter into thousands of sharp shards when broken so that everything that actually penetrates the armor does full damage.
