====== LightHarpoon ======
Created Wednesday 29 July 2015

The light harpoon is a pnematically powered gun that fires a small harpoon. The barbed hapoon sticks to a target and can be used to pull it using the grip where the wire is anchored on the gun.
The main downside of this gun is that you can't fire againbefore you repressurized the gun and pulled the harpoon back in.
