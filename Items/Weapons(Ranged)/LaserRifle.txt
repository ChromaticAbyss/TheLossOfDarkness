====== LaserRifle ======
Created Sunday 09 August 2015

Excellent long range weapon that is both silent and also completely unaffected by wind. The major downside is that the beam will lose a lot of its range and power in non clear air, moder smokescreens are especially effective at dissipating a laser beam in a shrt distance.
This leaves the laser as a good weapon for long range assassination but less good in actual combat scenarios where dust and smoke are commonplace.
