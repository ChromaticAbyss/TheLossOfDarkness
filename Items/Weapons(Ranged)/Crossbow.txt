====== Hunting Crossbow ======
Created Tuesday 30 June 2015

A ranged weapon that fires bolts that can easily be hammered from scrap metal, the advantage of dirt cheap ammunition is balanced out by a long manual reload after every shot, 
which isn't as much of a huge drawback on the hunt as it is in a full blown firefight.
The crossbow itself is also made from simple but well worked materials making repairs less costly and more time consuming.
