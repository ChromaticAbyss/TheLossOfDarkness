====== Ice ======
Created Donnerstag 03 September 2015

Ice is a drug that induces a physical and emotional coldness, reduces shaking while increasing manual dexterity.
Additionally it reduces body temperature generation which makes infrared detection less useful but also increases the dangers of cold.
While being extremely potent and somewhat affordable its also highly addictive.
It comes in the form of a square sugar pill usually with weird flavours that indicate the producer.
