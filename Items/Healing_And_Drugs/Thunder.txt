====== Thunder ======
Created Donnerstag 03 September 2015

Thunder is a powerful drug that empowers the use of bindings, granting a surge of increased effectiveness that lasts even longer as you exploit its effects. Increased casting during the effect is also linked to higher addiction rates.
One special thing about Thunder is that every dose hits like the first and people never require an increase of dosage.
Thunder can be taken by sniffing it which is fast or used as a candle which is popular in tribal areas.
