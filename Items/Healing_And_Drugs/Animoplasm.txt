=== Medicine ===
**Application**: 1 Action
**Check**: Medic(Normal)
The Syringe usually contains 10 Vitality worth of **Animoplasm**. 
To see how much maximum Vitality is contained within a **Hydraplasm** syringe roll 2D6, the actual potency has little to do with the volume of the liquid so can't be gauged before usage.

**Success**: Target gets the exact amount of HP intended from the user.
**Failure**: Roll a D6 and add it to the intended amount.

The missing Vitality is immediately restored.
Every 5 restored Vitality also close a wound near the injection site, this wound healing only takes 10 minutes.

To determine the sideeffects calculate the following(in order): 
**Hydramutagenity**
+Total Amount of health restored
+3 for each wound closed
+1 for each negative vitality point restored
+1 for each point of "overheal"
+2 on usage of **Hydraplasm**.


Whenever a character gains Hydramutagenity they will have to roll Resistance(Hard) and on failure a result happens that corresponds dependent on the **Hydramutagenity** of the character.
The Resistance check has a Bonus equal to the surplus Medic points if there are any.
0-4: Nothing of importance, only a small bump in [[OmegaFactor]] for several days.
5-14: Roll a small mutation from the [[Binding:Hydra:Hydra Mutations|Hydra Mutations table]].
15-24:Roll a large mutation from the [[Binding:Hydra:Hydra Mutations|Hydra Mutations table]].
25+: The character is obtains the [[Binding:Hydra|Hydra Binding]]. This is a neutral binding but the base difficulties of Hydra are high.
Characters lose only one stack of surplus **Hydramutagenity** each day so frequent applications of this remedy are dangerous.
