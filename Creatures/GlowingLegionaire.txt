====== GlowingLegionaire ======
Created Donnerstag 03 Dezember 2015

Humanoid but heavily mutated creatures that are covered in glowing runes that are known to sometimes harmlessly watch persons and sometimes viciously attack them. 
Usually bright light can deter the night dwelling creature from an attack, but if it isn't you better pack some serious firepower. 
They charge with the force and speed of a moving train, jump inhumanly far, rip people to shreds with long claws they can produce at will and root onlookers in fear.
Even if they sustain wound these creatures do not seem to suffer from pain and quickly recover from them.
The worst thing about them is that they tend to hunt in groups of 3.

Glowing Legionaire attacks are more common on traveling groups that have persons with [[Glow]] within them.
