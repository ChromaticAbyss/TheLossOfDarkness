====== ServitorDrone ======
Created Mittwoch 11 November 2015

A spiderlike metallic construct of the past that served to repair war machinery.
it is imbued with a **tormented steel** spirit, that commonly manifest via a screaming face on the machinery.
The tormented steel allows the machine to move without any pneumatics or other engine parts like one would expect from a classical fantasy skeleton.
The servitor drone has no weapons but can wield its metalworking tools as somewhat threatening melee implements.
