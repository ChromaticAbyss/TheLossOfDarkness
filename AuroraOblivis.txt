In the changed world one of the most drastic things that was taken away is the blackness of night. Its inhabitants don't know the night as a shadow that lays down on the world only lit by the stars and the lights you may carry like their ancestory might have.
Instead the absence of the sun is ruled by an all encompassing light phenomenon called the "**Aurora Oblivis**". In a way these dancing lights that encompass the skies resemble the nothern lights of the past. 
They share their sheer beauty and the fascination of the observers but the **Aurora Oblivis** is something far beyond that. Its a living thing that slowly captures and traps the mind of the watchers, leading to them loosing themselves in the noctiluscient labyrinths that 
spontanously shift and change hue, seemingly hiding a cryptic message, some universal truth that is just barely out of reach and could be deciphered at any given moment. Many of those enthralled by its sheer beauty and infinite mystery freeze to death or just completely lose their identity 
spending night after night just staring at the skies.
The **Aurora Oblivis** easily draws the attention of anyone that can't find powerful distraction, its changing light suggesting movement in every shadow even turning rusty ruins into dancers.

There are ways to protect onself from this potentially threatening influence the most important of which is to not wander around at night. If a tent or enclosed space is not available or movement is neccessary a powerful source of light can help blind against its influence
but also makes for an easy target. 
Other less used options are certain [[Attributes|Willpower]] enhancing drugs,sleeping drugs or company that can catch anyone that drifts away and shake them out of it.
In general keeping the exposure short will also help a lot.


General exposure rules
Every hour a character may be exposed to the Aura Oblivis the may have to pass a **normal** [[Abilities:MentalFortitude|Mental Fortitude]] + [[Attributes|Willpower]] check with the following modifiers. 
-1 for each consequtive hour spend exposed
+1 for distraction
+2 for awake company
+2 for being asleep
+1 to +3 for light
+3 for basic cover that still lets some light through(thin tent, lush trees etc.)

The check automatially passes if the modifier reachers +5 or more aswell as indoors or underground., most tents are thick and black and count as indoors.
In these cases the characters do not count as exposed for the duration, exposure counts whenever the test needs to be rolled even if its passed.
A person sleeping in a thin tent would get a +3+2 and thus not be affected at all. If for some reason they would wake up for an hour they would have to take a test. 
Even if they manage to fall back asleep after an hour they get a -1 for being exposed and now have only a +4 thus have to take the checks for the rest of the night.


Results of failing the [[Abilities:MentalFortitude|Mental Fortitude]] check:
The character can't regenerate Stability this day, loses 1 point of it. 
Characters with 20 or more [[Glow]] will lose 2 points of Stability instead of 1. 

Characters also don't regenerate [[Glow]] during an hour they are exposed. This can only be prevented by not being exposed, [[Abilities:MentalFortitude|Mental Fortitude]] doen't help here .

A character that drops below 5 [[Attributes:Stability|Stability]] by this mechanism replaces his usual consequences with a strong disconnection from the world and a desire to get full exposure of the **Aurora Oblivis** which might even involve getting up from sleep(which will likely be noticed by companions).
A character that drops below 0 [[Attributes:Stability|Stability]] by this mechanism will become completely absorbed by the Aurora Oblivis, unable to act and loses 1 Stability each 10 minutes of further exposure. This complete absence of mind and staring into the distance keeps going on 
even if the character is removed from the influence of the Aurora instantly until the character has 0 or more Stability again.
A character that falls to his negative maximum of [[Attributes:Stability|Stability]] will just stay in this comatose state forever.
