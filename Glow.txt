====== Glow ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

Everytime a character uses the special abilities of their [[Binding|Bindings]] he aquires Glow. 
If a character aquires Glow and afterwards has more than his threshold(default is 5) they must pass an **easy** cast check or the glow triggers.
This check will be one category harder for each multiple that is crossed, for example aquiring Glow that puts him above 10 would force a standard character to roll a **normal** cast check, above 15 it would be a **hard** check and so on.

If a Cast check fails the caster rolls 1D20 and looks up their BurnTable.
If the Cast had an ally as target that allys burn table also procs(uses their Glow for the calculation)!
