====== Glow ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

**Glow** is a kind of building up interference that acts as a resource for binding usage. Glow is not detectable with the naked eye but technology exists to detect it.  
The more different bindings a character has the more danger is posed by acculmulated glow as the different Bindings interfere with each other, fighting for dominance.
Whenever they accumulate too much **Glow**, a character has to fight against a potantially dangerous chain reaction called a **Burn** or **Burnoff.** 


Everytime characters use the special abilities of their [[Binding|Bindings]] they aquire **Glow** equal to that abilities stated **Glow cost**. 
If a character aquires **Glow** and afterwards has more than his [[Attributes:GlowThreshold|Glow-threshold]](default is 5) they must pass an **easy** [[Abilities:Cast|Cast]] + [[Attributes|Intelligence]] check or the **Burnoff** triggers.
This check will be **one category harder** for each multiple that is crossed, for example aquiring **Glow** that puts them above 10 would force a standard character to roll a **normal** cast check, above 15 it would be a **hard** check and so on.

**Burn**
If such a [[Abilities:Cast|Cast]] check fails the caster rolls 1D20 and looks up their [[BurnTable]]. If a slot has multile different entries all of them fire!
Despite sometimes being referred to as a **Burnoff** this event does **not** reduce a characters **Glow**!


**Fall Off**
Every hour that passes without aquiring further **Glow** reduces the amount by one.
While exposed to the [[AuroraOblivis|Aurora Oblivis]]  a character can not reduce their **Glow** even if they are mentally unaffected by it (sucessful [[Abilities:MentalFortitude|Mental Fortitude]] check).
