====== Blunt ======
Created Freitag 18 September 2015

A mechanical damage type. Deals damage by compressing tissue and breaking bones.

**Blune Damage** is reduced by **Blunt Armor** in the zone it hits.
Blunt damage kills by causing wounds if the damage reaches the wound threshold(multiple wounds on reaching multiples of that). Also half of blunt damage gets deducted from the targets [[Attributes:Vitality|Vitality]] if the zone that got hit is the **Torso** or **Head**.
