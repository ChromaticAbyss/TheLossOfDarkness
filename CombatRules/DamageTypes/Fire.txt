====== Fire ======
Created Sonntag 25 Oktober 2015

Fire damage wreathes a target in flame. 

**Fire Damage** is reduced by **Fire Armor** in the zone it hits. The remainder is added as **Burn. **

The **Burn** damage is applied as [[Attributes:Vitality|Vitality]] loss each turn (zone doesn't matter). 
Burn damage can stack over multiple turns to cause burn wounds!

A character can roll on the ground to remove **Burn, ** one action spent reduces the burn by 1D3. A fireproof blanket or a fire extinguisher work much better.

**Burn wound**
Extremely painful destruction of the skin (-1 modifier to all skills due to pain)
Double likelyhood of infection.
