====== Pierce ======
Created Freitag 18 September 2015

A mechanical damage type deals damage by penetrating tissue and ripping it apart, destroying organs.

**Pierce Damage** is reduced by **Pierce Armor** in the zone it hits.
Pierce damage kills by causing wounds if the damage reaches the wound threshold(multiple wounds on reaching multiples of that). Also half of pierce damage gets deducted from the targets [[Attributes:Vitality|Vitality]] if the zone that got hit is the **Torso** or **Head**.
