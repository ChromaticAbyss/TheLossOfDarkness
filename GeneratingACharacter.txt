====== GeneratingACharacter ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

A character has 6 [[Attributes]]: Burst,Endurance, Dexterity, Intelligence, Willpower, Awareness. Allocate 18 points as is described in the [[Attributes]] page (-1 to 6 range).

Each character starts with **150** [[ProgressPoints]] (**PP**).

There are the following options for spending these:
[[Abilities]] per the usual rules, should make up at least 100 of the points.
Beginner(5 PP), Intermediate(15 = 5+10 PP), Experienced(35 = 5+10+20PP), Professional(75 = 5+10+20+40PP)
Note that some abilities require explaination in the background and a lot of them grant fitting starting equipment.
Its also possible to buy Specialisations for **PP** right from the start if the respective Abilities are high enough. 

There are a few other things to spend points on that are only accessible upon generating a character:
**+1 point in an attribute **costs 25 PP (up to twice)

**Bindings/Mutations **
Its possible and encouraged to start characters with Bindings!
The rolls for the binding will still apply (usually after you finish everything else, it may be useful to keep a few **PP** to react to mutations).
However since the character probably had a long time to get used to this Binding **all rolls** necessary are one category **easier**! 
Each **Binding** has its own attribute(the [[Binding:BindingMastery|mastery]]) which starts at **5** for Bindings purchased in character generation.

These are the Bindings that a character can start with. 
All checks are **normal** difficults by default for these so they become **easy,** none of these have crippling mutations or burn table entries.

[[Binding:Crystalline|Crystalline]]
[[Binding:Trickster|Trickster]]
[[Binding:Spectrum|Spectrum]]
[[Binding:Consuming|Consuming]]
[[Binding:Drifter|Drifter]]
[[Binding:Reach|Reach]]

a few also common but more intrusive ones are to be used mainly for characters where the downside can shape the character or be avoided by having fitting skills.
