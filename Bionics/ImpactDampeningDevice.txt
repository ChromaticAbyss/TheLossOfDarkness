Slots: Spine,Leg(2x)

This modified spine is extremely resistant to the kind of compression that happens when breaking a large fall. To use this implant a certain amount of self control is needed to land on your legs(Obstacle 3).
Fall damage even at terminal velocity is capped at 10 points.
Any fall damage lower than 10 is halved.
