====== Bleeding Spectrum ======
Created Saturday 19 December 2015

[Spoilers]

A floating white fog with feint tendrils that bleeds out colours at the edges. 
The **Bleeding Spectrum** is a minion of **the Watcher** that resembles the **Spectrum** unbound and has most of its abilities. The Bleeding Spectrum also has a few abilities that affect the mind of enemies making it at least a little more dangerous than the regular Spectrum entity.

**Stats:**
[[Unbound|Agency]]:  6


**Behaviour:**
Usually a silent observer that follows persons around. 
In a fight it may use **chromatic dissection(see below) **with a skill level of 7 to aid other watcher demons. In the worst case it will use that ability repeatedly to deplete a characters stability and allow for an escape.



=== Special Rules: ===
**Incorporeal(Fade Shadow)**
Can pass right through anything that doesn't have a representation in the** Fade**(solid walls, some tree trunks).
Which also means that physical weapons will not do damage.
The situation is different is the creature is fought from within the **Fade: **Physical weapons are able to disperse the mist like creature instead of passing through them, the unbounds takes 1/3 of the regular damage.

**Invisible(Fade Shadow)**	
This creature is pretty much invisible unless observed from the **Fade.**
A very aware character may spot it as a spot of slightly dampening colours following them if they pass a **very** **hard** [[Attributes|Awareness]] check, if the [[Binding:Spectrum|Spectrums]] augmented vision is used the check is additionally **normal** difficulty only. 



=== Binding ===
See [[Binding:Spectrum|Spectrum,]] can stack with that(in that case the new starting cast is also gained).

Starting Cast is replaced with
**Chromatic Dissection:** 
[Starting Cast]
**Glow**: 4 , 1 Action
Focus in on a target, that target must roll a [[Abilities:MentalFortitude|Mental Fortitude]] + [[Attributes|Awareness]] (**normal**) defense check, on a failure the target loses 1 [[Attributes:Stability|Stability]] and is **Highlighted** for the caster.
**Hightlighted** characters/entities can not hide from the caster and are even visible through walls. Ranged attacks against a **highlighted** target gain a +2 bonus, and casts against them can only be defended by them with a -2 modifier.
The **Highlighting **subsides after [[Binding:BindingMastery|Binding Mastery]] * 2 turns of combat or if they leave further than 200 metres.
Its also possible to use this against inanimate objects.
[[Binding:BindingMastery|Binding Mastery]] 5+: Can choose nearby allies for which the target also is highlighted, +4 [[Glow]] cost per ally.
