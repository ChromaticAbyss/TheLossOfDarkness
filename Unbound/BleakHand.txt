====== BleakHand ======
Created Saturday 19 December 2015

[Spoilers]

The Void eye is a **Fade **borne creature that consist of a main body that sprouts long bone less arms with clawing hands. 
Its the most powerful minion of the watcher in terms of combat abilities and can easily fight multiple enemies at once.



**Stats:**
[[Unbound|Agency]]:  50

[[Abilities:Reflexes|Reflexes]] (Melee Defense): 10
[[Abilities:Cover]]  (Shadow Shroud): 6


**Behaviour:**
The **Bleak Hand** has 1 Actions + 1 for each full 20 [[Unbound|Agency.]]

1 Action: **Melee Attack**: **7**, Damage **1D6+1** Piercing damage, also adds 1 point of [[Abilities:HandToHand|supression]]. 

1 Action: **Absorb Information**(Refuge of Nightmare): Drains the reality out of a zone around the creature. 
Deals Stability damage for everyone inside the area each turn of combat unless they pass xyz check, the creature gains [[Unbound|Agency]] for damage dealt this way.

1 Action: **Consuming Tether**, attempts to connect if not xyz(hard) check is passed. On a fail character has to roll xyz(normal) each time they begin a turn. On a fail they can't act this turn, loses 1 [[Attributes|Stability]] and the Bleak Hand gains 1 [[Unbound|Agency.]]
If the check is passed twice in a row the tether is broken and can't be restored this fight, also the **Bleak Hand **loses 3 Agency. 



=== Special Rules ===
**Incorporeal(Fade Shadow)**
Can pass right through anything that doesn't have a representation in the** Fade**(solid walls, some tree trunks).
Which also means that physical weapons will not do damage.
The situation is different if the creature is fought from within the **Fade: **Physical weapons deal full damage to the creature that is fully corporeal here.

**Invisible(Fade Shadow)**	
This creature is pretty much invisible unless observed from the **Fade.**
A very aware character may spot it as a spot of slightly dampening colours following them if they pass a **very** **hard** [[Attributes|Awareness]] check, if the [[Binding:Spectrum|Spectrums]] augmented vision is used the check is additionally **normal** difficulty only. 

**Counterattack**
Succesfully defending against a melee attack allows this creature to deal 2 damage to the attacker. 

**Shadow Shroud**
This creature has a cover rating of 6 at all times.


=== Binding ===
**Grasping Shadows**
Stability loss checks recieve an additional -2 modifier.
+2 points of Binding Mastery
