**Specialisations/Casts:** 

**Silver Tongue:** [Starting Cast]
		   Glow: 5 , 0 Actions(when promted)
		   Using this Cast you can add your [[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]] to a single Fast Talk skill check. 
		
**Intrigue**:  Cost: 3 PP, Requires [[Binding:BindingMastery]] 4		
		Passive
		You may cast **Silver Tongue** on negotiation checks. 
		If you want you can also replace your actual Negotiation skill with half of your Fast Talk skill in that instance.
		
**Dazzle**:  Cost: 7 PP, Requires [[Binding:BindingMastery]] 3		
		 Cast: Glow: 7, 1 Action
		 Attempts to confuse and stun a thing with a brain. You duel your [[Binding:BindingMastery]](normal check) against their Willpower(normal check). If you succeed the target is stunned for one turn of combat.
		 In parallel to casting Dazzle you can perform any Move/Chase or Cover action but not cast something else or attack. This property makes **Dazzle** good for getaways but less useful in direct combat (unless you brough allies).
		Range: [[Binding:BindingMastery]] in metres.
		
**Greater Confusion:** Cost: 7 PP, Requires [[Binding:BindingMastery]] 7, **Dazzle**		
		Cast: Glow 18, 1 Action
		Works like Dazzle except that it targets any person you want within [[Binding:BindingMastery]] metres. Not only does this stun groups it also stuns for 2 Turns instead of one.
		This is again useful for escaping groups of people or to initiate a fight.
			 In parallel to casting Greater Confusion you can perform any Move/Chase or Cover action but not cast something else or attack
		
**Magic Trick**:  Cost: 2 PP, Requires [[Binding:BindingMastery]] 3		
			   Cast: Glow: 1, 1+ Action
		   Performs one or a series of "street magic" tricks. A good way to entertain guests or earn a little money in a city.

**Tricksters Contract:** Cost: 6 PP, Requires [[Binding:BindingMastery]] 6
				  Cast: Glow 10, 1 Handshake
				  Cast this upon making a contract sealed with a sign, stam, handshake etc.
				  Whenever your victim tries to break the contract(they can only try once a day) they must do a a duel against you: Your [[Binding:BindingMastery]](normal check) against their Willpower(normal check)(use the Willpower value you had when making the contract) if they fail they are bound by the 
				  words of the  contract.  If they win a duel they can break it. 
				  Just thinking about breaking the contract does not count as a try btw.
				  **Note:** You can break your end of the bargain at any time you want(you are a trickster after all), doing so removes the effect from your victim though.
