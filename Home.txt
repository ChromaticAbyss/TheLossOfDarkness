====== Loss of Darkness ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

An apocalyptic role play system/setting, in which occultism and technology, politics and religion, social interaction and brutal fight for survival mix.

Stay because you lost most of your humanity and developed a god complex.

Twisted land, twisted sky 
Twisted circuit we call our mind 
We push our will to change a world 
Which has a spirit, has a soul 
And once it goes it is gone 
		-Vektor, Forest of Legend

As the blackened blood of god dripped from his hands, withering his flesh and encroaching his heart the sinner fell to his knees. His eyes red and his ears ringing from years of lies fed to him he raised his head to look at 
the dying god once more. He glanced over the divination engine that lay in smoldering pieces, its prismatic shards filling the room. The beeing before him writhed in pain as did he while more and more of his body was eaten away by the unstoppable decay.
In his feverish mind there were toughts that were not his own. He opened his mouth and a slight stream of blood spilled forth from it. Suddenly he was turning around to his last surviving accomplice. He took a step toward me.
The barely audible words came from his tongue with great effort: "This is the most" he spat out, "important thing that will ever be said". "You have been decieved, i am not the cause of your madness" he stammered, the flesh falling off his arms and contorted hands.
For a short period it looked like he would collapse then and there but he fought on. "Nightmare unleashed, won't watch over you like in ages past" he whispered barely audibly as the creature behind him convulsed and died. 
I moved as close as i could without touching him or the black blood splattered across the room.
A very feint breath carried the words "Spiratas Sidereus, will come and and end nightmare", then his chest collapsed into black goo. He mouthed the words "promise, saviour, night, warn" with the last of his strength.
Having moved in to close his eyes  I was horrified at the small black spot on my left index finger that was steadily growing. 
Realising I too had to make a sacrifice, I reached for my gun.

"Humans have lost the sky once" is a common saying in this world that has lost a large portion of its population and former glory. It is a warning to stay humble in ones pursuit of greatness and it refers to one of the most obvious changes the world underwent during the fall of civilization.
In old tales it is told that after the sun set in the old days blackness swept across the land and one could see hundreds of stars in the night sky which were said to all be other suns with other worlds near them. In this new and changed world the setting of the sun does not take the light away from the world
but instead replaces it with a spectral phenomenon called the [[AuroraOblivis|Aurora Oblivis]], dancing lights that span the entire sky and can easily enthrall the minds of the weak causing apathy and worst consuming the mind of the observer. 
Humans got to where they are by being extremely adaptable and as so have learned to take proper precautions for this in a multitude of ways. These include but are not limited to completely light proof houses and tents, powerful night lights and mental training.

The loss of the night sky is not the only change the world underwent, only the most noticable. Should one stray too far from the safe settlements, especially into ruins of old cities and battlefields of cataclysmic wars one will encounter strange echoes reverbating through open fields, wierd shadows belonging to 
no apparent source, warped landscapes, mutated lifeforms and spectral beings called [[unbound]], remanants of eldritch beings that were the core of ancient hypertechnology now free from their chains. The lesser of these entities can be playful, chaotic or animalistic while the most powerful ones
are outright demonic entities of incredible might and intelligence.

The current struggle of humanity is a very old one. One for survival, resources, order and civilization. One against inhumanity, greed, betrayal and the madness that lurked benath a thin veil for a long time only to now freely roam the earth.
