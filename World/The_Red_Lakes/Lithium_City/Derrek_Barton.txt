====== Derrek Barton ======
Created Mittwoch 23 September 2015

General in command of the Red Lake Autonomy Defense Force(RLADF, also known as ADF). The general of about 40 years sees himself as a spiritual successor to General Kastan Firdust which led the army of purity before he was murdered about the time Ryan was a little boy. 
Derrek has about the same level of dedication to the task as Kastan had before he started compromising and has no intention of repeating the same "mistake" of tolerance that let Kastan to his demise.
