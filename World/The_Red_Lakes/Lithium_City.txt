====== Lithium City ======
Created Mittwoch 23 September 2015

Lithium city is situated between the centre and the last lake and has a quite large sphere of influence. Its a city dominated by the military under General [[+Derrek Barton|Derrek Barton]].
Visitors are only allowed in the civics district in the centre of town.
Another thing that stands out is the massive security of the town. Where others have border patrols or automated defense machanisms Lithium city has **tanks.** The main purpose of these is showing strength in the standoff against [[World:The Red Lakes:Bloodline|the bloodline]].
A common honour is to be promoted to **Seargant of the Airforce** this does nothing since there is no Airforce but the thus honoured person is no longer considered a civilian.

Lithium city also has some of the strictest laws in the whole area:
* Nonmedical use, sale and possession of all drugs is forbidden
* Public alcohol use is also forbidden aswell as owning a pub or brothel
* A strictly enforced curfew at night
* Within the city walls(which make up almost the entire area) no mutants or persons associated with mutants or the bloodline are allowed.
* Noncompliance with any orders from military personel is also punishable
