====== Cin Con Caph ======
Created Monday 28 December 2015

Cin Con Caph is a [[Bloodline]] city that formally belongs to the Red Lake Autonomy. It has a more tribal and diverse feeling than other cities in the Red Lake autonomy and is stretched along the white water river for a long distance.
While it has lots of bridges and bridge buildings that span the white water river or are even built in the middle of it the best way to get around is still by boat. Almost every large building has a basement level that can be reached by boat, sometimes using some of the obscure tunnels that usually lead out towards the fields but sometimes end in unexpected places.

The city appears to be on a low technological scale because of it lacking a citywide power grid. Much of the work is done by mechanical energy harvested from the river and individual houses may have power generators for their own needs.
Lantern bearing partols roam the streets at night collecting the rare [[AuroraOblivis|Aurora]] victims. In general people here are much more open about most unusual phenomena, the religion of the [[World:Religions:TrueShape|True Shape]] has a following here alongside [[World:Religions:Revas|Revas]].
