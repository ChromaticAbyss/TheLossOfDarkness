====== Oxygen City ======
Created Mittwoch 07 Oktober 2015

The largest city of the **Red Lake Autonomy** resides at **the last lake**. It is connected via pipeline to **Hydrogen city.** 

Oxygen city contains two major parts, one called **The Fortress** that is ruled by the **Chapter of Purity** in both religion and politics. **The Fortress** is the only access point to **Hydrogen city** and also heavily fortified with towering walls and heavy steel doors. Every citizen getting into **The Fortress** will be screened for mutations very throughly and will also have to have a talk with an **Agent of the Chapter** when entering for the first time. The streets inside are clean like nowhere else, patrolled no only by armed officers and clerics of the chapter but also by small airborne surveillance drones.
Persons suspected of working with the **Bloodline** will be denied access to the city on a mere suspicion, persons part of the bloodline hierachy (this even counts the three council members) will be executed on the spot.

The second part is called **(The) Split. **A one hundred metre wide strip of no mans land seperates it from **The Fortress, **it features no differentiation from the outside and much smaller buildings. Large portions of **Split** are slum like areas that are filled with mutants or other "filth" the chapter would never allow inside. 
This "filth" includes people from the other religions, including:
Revas(The former Arennian state religion is as popular here as it is in all other cities that don't spring from the bloodline), The left Behind(the only **Sancturary** in the entire region is found here), True Shape(very popular in the mutant quarters) and Watchers of Dusk(a few, most of them have ben assimilated into the Chapter or crossed the lake to find [[World:Persons:Giles Sa Vera|Giles Sa vera]]).
Drug trade and consumption runs rampant in **The Split**, despite the occasional bloody attempts of the chapter to purge it. **The Split **with its huge **Red Light Market** may be the only place in the whole city that features a "night life".
During the day most people here work in the huge agricultural zone required to feed the town, as construction workers, mercenaries or survive illegal activities.

Each of those two parts of the city is a city on its own, based on population size.


Persons 
**Kassius Verger** - Ex Munditus of purity, was given a Hydra overdose by an enemy, now a mutant beggar in **Split.** Considers himself a cripple and refuses to use his mutation.
