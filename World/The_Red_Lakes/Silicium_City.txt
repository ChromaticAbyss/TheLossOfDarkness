====== Silicium City ======
Created Sonntag 13 Dezember 2015

=== Bloodline name: San Te Kriin ===

This city is an old tribal city of the bloodline, separated from [[World:The Red Lakes:Lithium City|Lithium City]] by the first lake and the grey bog. 
It features no protective measures against anything coming from the outside and no separation between different parts of the city.

Notable is the fact that the soil is very instable at most places and the few hills of stable ground have been overtaken by the high tech industry that gives this city its name.
Between these factories that create and salvage high tech matrials resources are exchanged using wire mounted transport units. Below them on the structurably weak ground the regular housings, markets and brothels find their places.

Silicium city also harbours a large complex owned by **Argu Sy Sera **named **Cauldron **of which only the lower level can be accessed by the public. In the rooms of this lower floor one can find many services not usually accessible such as trade with Hypertechnology, Containments, Bindings for money and training in the occult arts.

=== Population ===
~3000 Citizens

=== Location ===
First Lake, the white water river flows into the first lake near this town. 

=== Notables ===


=== Connections ===
Down the first lake there is a connection to lithium city but the bad realations between the Bloodline and the Chapter controlled cities mean that few people have reason to travel this route. 
Upriver lies the other great [[The Red Lakes:Bloodline|Bloodline]] city of Cin Con Caph.

=== Government ===
The city is now ruled by **Kyrne Esta Estras,** after she overtook many of the factories. Tough rulership in the [[Bloodline]] just means the largest amount of power, not power over the entirety of the city.
Also residing in Silicium city is the exiled council member **Rehad Estra Vird**.
