====== Bloodline ======
Created Donnerstag 27 August 2015

{{../../../Pictures/BloodlineSysmbol1.png}}

The Bloodline controls the upriver part of the red lake autonomy[LINK]. The two main cities they control are called Cin Caph[Link] and Akura Asten/Silicium City[Link].
The Bloodline values personal skill and cunning over democratic elections and morale.
Of all the factions in the Red Lake[Link] area they are the most accepting of mutants, allowing binders to both teach and practice freely.

The bloodline holdings are in constant turmoil and under neverending attack from foes both inside and outside the Red Lake Autonomy[Link] so it is little wonder
that they like no other strive to rediscover and perfect the art of weaponmaking. A citizen of the Bloodline can not rely on any authorities caring for them so they may have 
to defend their lives with their own weapon. While the wealthiest and most powerful citizens have bodyguards around them at most times the poorest might carry a fake gun 
as to not look like easy prey.

=== Interactions with the rest of the Red Lake Autonomy ===
The Bloodline controls two major cities of the Red Lake area and are somewhat shunned by the other factions.
Most cities won't openly trade with persons from or associating with the Bloodline. 
While the Bloodline has 3 seats in the council of the 44 the three members sent are seen as criminals by law of the other factions and
thus exiled from the council itself. As they can't partake in the decision process the Bloodline has very little direct political influence.
What they do have however is secret supporters in most of the major settlements of the Red Lake Autonomy.


=== Interactions with the outside ===
Loose contact exists to a number of small settlements outside the Red Lake area, especially along the White Water river[Link].
With these the Bloodline trades outdated guns and supplies for valuable information on events in the wilds and scraps for recycling.



=== History ===
The bloodline traces their roots back to a group of mutated warriors that ruled the White Water River[Link] and protected aswell as extorted and somewhat terrified the
small fortresses along the river and the Grey Bog[Link] it ended in. These warriors suffered heavy casulties against the warlord Iden Yamah[Link] which fielded a terrifying army
of mutants and binders constantly moving into the territory of the early bloodline.
The tribe was put under even more strain as the colonists from the [[World:RepublicOfLowerArenna|Republic of Lower Arenna]] marched in from the opposite direction capturing a huge portion of the 
territory once under Bloodline rule. Under the influx of settlers the cities grew in size vastly and the base for the infrastructure currently present in the Red Lake area was set.
Enthralled by the growing prosperity and fertility of the land Iden Yamah[Link] set his sights to conquer it. 
In a massive standoff in the area beyond the mountains now called Irondust Vaste[Link] the two armies collided. 
General Kastan Firdust's army of purity fueled by a searing hate for everything mutated and occult ran right into a trap set by Iden Yamah[Link] and was slaughtred by
use of mutants, bindings and possessed weaponry. So much otherworldly power was used with so little concern that the [[World:Gritting Waste|Gritting Waste]] can easily compare to the vast battlefields of the cataclysm.
Kastan Firdust however escaped the nightmare that unfolded and a few days later approached the scattered remains of the Bloodline asking for help against a foe they fought for a long time.
In exchange for a peace treaty, lots of their territory and massive reparations they agreed to take up arms against Iden Yamah[Link] and his maddened army.
Due to being on even footing with their binding abilities the Bloodline won quite a few skirmishes against Idens forces up to the point where he personally intervened with his elite guard.
This caused a costly stalemate that lasted until Iden and Firdust agreed on negotiations about new borders. 
Neither trusting Firdust nor Iden a group Bloodline binders used this opportunity to assassinate both leaders in one swing by summoning the greater demon Weltenbrand[Link] that incinerated everything within miles.
Even after all those responsible for the summoning were exceuted the sentiment of the non bloodline part of the Red Lake area rapidly swung back away from liking binders and mutants into the state they are in now.
Meanwhile the Pyroclasm[Link] continued to rage for decades consuming cities and resources in its path. 
During these troublesome years the Red Lake autonomy[Link] officially formed and the Bloodline has always been looked at with suspicion or even hatred from a lot of people, despite them being the ones that suffer most from all the things that they are hated for.



=== Currency ===
The main currency is the RLA credit (1 TU).
Also commonly used are dogtags from the General Kastan Firdust's army of purity and special "coins" minted to look similar to these dogtags(10 TU).
