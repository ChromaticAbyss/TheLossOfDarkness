====== Fey ======
Created Dienstag 15 Dezember 2015

Fey is a fragile looking woman with a quiet voice. She always appears to be one or two metres further away than she actually is and sometimes a little more bright than she should be while standing in a shadow.
Fey is the cartographers linguist but also good at getting into places she shouldn't get into.
While its quite obvious that something is not entirely right about Fey she doesn't consider herself a mutant or otherwise unnatural since she grew up this way. 
She does sometimes use the starting casts her bindings unconsciously.
