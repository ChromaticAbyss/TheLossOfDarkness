====== Cassidy Zaneth ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2015

Cassidy Zaneth is the leader of the Cartographers organisation.
His outer appearance is rugged, one of his arms is a bionic percision tool. He lost an arm in an accident and opted to have an arm specifially modified for precision work.
Aside from drawing maps and other things he likes to work on clocks and other fine mechanical things.
He is the main person that makes and reads the maps a skill he teaches all others with a passion, tough not a lot of people can compare to the extreme precision his bionic arm offers.
 "Nobody ever did evil by reading a map"
