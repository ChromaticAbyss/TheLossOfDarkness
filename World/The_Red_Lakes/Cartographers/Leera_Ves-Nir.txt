====== Leera Ves-Nir ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2015

Leera is one of the scouts of the Cartographers.
As a scout she has to be alone away from the convoy quite a lot and explore roads and locations beforehand. 
She has a knack for getting into trouble but is also quite good at getting out of it, her plentiful mutations helping out in both regards.
