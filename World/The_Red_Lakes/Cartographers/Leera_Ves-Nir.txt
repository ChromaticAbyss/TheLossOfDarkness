====== Leera Ves-Nir ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2015

Leera is the scout/technician of the Cartographers.
As a scout she has to be alone away from the convoy quite a lot and explore roads and locations beforehand. 
She has a knack for getting into trouble but is also quite good at getting out of it, her plentiful mutations helping out in both regards.
Her other great passion is mountaineering. When she was a more or less normal human a fall from great height nearly killed her, a high dose of Animoplasm saved her life but left her paralyzed.
Scrapping together lots of cash a bionic spine was bought for her and implanted to replace her damaged nerve cords. The implant had multiple malfunctions requiring two follow up operations,
each of which was sealed with a dose of cheap Hydraplasm to get going faster. The high dosage over a short time made her fuse with the Hydra enabling her body to self heal. 
The implant is now useless and slowly broken down by her body. Leera saw her Binding as an awesome new possibility and immediately studied it and its interactions with great curiosity and will to learn.
She has a large grief against anyone who rejects their amazing possibilities.

Since Leera has the Cast skill its rare to have anything happen here. If she has to push really hard she will likely get new small mutation.
