====== Pete The Hand ======
Created Montag 14 Dezember 2015

Pete is pretty close to the classical mercenary archetype with his preferrence for running around dirty, in armor, machinegun on his back, knack for gambling, smoking and booze.
It might surprise that he is a pretty intelligent man and the main medic and technician and cares for most of the delicate high tech equipment such as laser distance measurement.
