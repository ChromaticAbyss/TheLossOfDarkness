====== Attes Sy Estras ======
Created Donnerstag 27 August 2015

Also known as The Inquisitor Attes wears a golden robe and a greatsword whenever he appears in public.
He is generally the one tasked with riling up the population for organised raids and counterraids against the denizens of the wastelands.
Although he definitely knows how to use a gun he prefers going close up to enemies to demonstrate his unparalleled savy with the sword.
He has the Hydra binding which regenerates any and all wounds he sustaines in these battles.
