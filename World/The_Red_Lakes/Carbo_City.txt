{{../../../Pictures/CarboCity_Map.png?width=800}}

**Population**: ~3000 Citizens, ~2000 Slum inhabitants
**Location**: Last Lake

**Notables**: 
The mud river flows into the "last lake" near this town and is used for **hydroelectric power** generation and **river docks**. 
Industrial and even slum areas are fortified by automatic **gunturrets** every few hundred metres, that scan and warn human intruders but won't open fire unless someone gets very close to them(self defense)
A r**efinery** that turns red algae into fuel, a large **fish processing factory**. A few square kilometers of famland that is irrigated by the mud river and a sink for the factories biowaste.

**Connections**: 
The red ring road leads "eastward" wards Lithium city and "westward"  the morgue road goes to Spires. A small boat may take you upwards the mud river. 
Ships can cross the last lake to reach Aqua, Oxygen, Lithium and Hydrogen city.

**Government:**
This city is ruled by 3 big families: 
The Gevera which own the hydroelectric plant, the refinery and a lot of the farmland by proxy.
The Estra Haba which own the carbon works, the city police, the gunworks and most of the dock infrastructure.
The Reffa which own the fish processing plant alongside three fishing trawlers on the lakes, they also have control over most estabilshments in town.

Carbo city sends 5 council members to Hydrogen city usually 2 Gevera, 2 Din Haba and 1 Reffa. internally the order is controlled mostly by the Gavellis and the Reffas due to their control over the masses.
The way their descision making works is not visible to the normal citizens of the city but is usually fair. 
It helps that the families all are known for discipline and lack of decadence so that only the people in the slums sometimes get violent.
