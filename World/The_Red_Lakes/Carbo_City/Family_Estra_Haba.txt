{{../../../../Pictures/Family_EstraHaba.png?width=300}}

The Estra Haba is one of the most influencial families in Carbo City. members of this family own the namesake [[World:Persons:Mahd Estra Haba|carbon works]], [[World:Persons:Jyne Estra Haba|lead the city police]], [[World:Persons:Theresia Estra Haba|manage the docks]] and [[World:Persons:Melis Estra Haba|own dock infrastructure]]. 
They proudly trace back their history to the Bloodline tribe and the still grand Estra family of the Bloodline. One should however not make the mistake of associating them with the political faction [[World:The Red Lakes:Bloodline|Bloodline]] from which they distance themselves emphatically.

=== Values of the organisation ===
**Helping each other**: There a few things an Estra Haba could do to be expelled from the tight network of the family, helping one another is a matter of course. Many Estra Haba preferrably fill the ranks below them with family members. 
**Safety of the town**: The Estra Haba care a lot about the safety of the town and even its lowest inhabitants and as such tend to overspend on security.
