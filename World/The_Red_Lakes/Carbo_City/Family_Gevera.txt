"We are not in the buisness of saving lives. We are in the buisness of making buisness"

The Gevera family is **the** most influential family in Carbo City. Their roots lie in the settlers from the great push out of [[World:RepublicOfLowerArenna|Lower Arenna]] but they take in anyone with a keen sense of buisness and strong loyalties.

The head of the family is [[World:Persons:Kastav Gevera|Kastav Gevera]] which mediates all internal problems and has the final say on all important matters. 
[[World:Persons:Alayine Gevera|Alayine Gevera]] is responsible for the refinery and farmland. She is hated excessively by the poor of the city for forcing the farmers to grow oilstalk instead of potatoes, turnips and other food.
The Gevera Family has two people in the great council.

=== Values of the organisation ===
