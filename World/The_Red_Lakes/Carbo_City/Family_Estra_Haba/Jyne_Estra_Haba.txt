====== Jyne Estra Haba ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2015

Jyne [[World:The Red Lakes:Carbo City:Family Estra Haba|Estra Haba]] is the head of the [[World:The Red Lakes:Carbo City|Carbo City]] police force. She is commonly seen as somewhat corrupt since she gradually replaced half of the police force with [[World:The Red Lakes:Carbo City:Family Estra Haba|Estra Haba]] family members or persons assoziated with them. 
Despite that she seems to do a good job as indicated by the nonexistant crime rate in the core city and the fast response to trouble outside of the core.
When off duty she can often be seen fishing at a lake or playing a hand of cards at the "Murky Waters".
