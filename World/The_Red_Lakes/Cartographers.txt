====== Cartographers ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2015

Also known as "Imperial Arennian Prospector Unit 7"

The cartographers are an organisation of world weary explorers comitted to the difficult of charting the unknowns beyond the red lakes.
They are funded by the council of the 44 which grants them permissing to take certain amounts of resources from cities. Since there is no recompense for this at all their arrival causes strife and unrest, some people go as far as to call them nothing more then bandits.
This isn't helped by the fact that many members of the cartographers have a certain vagabond look and feel to them and neither by the fact that a lot of them have mutations.

They roam the lands in 6 half tracks that are modified to be extremely durable and also outfitted with light weaponry. One truck carries a screw based vehicle to explore really difficult terrain and traverse bodies of water. A few bikes and two motorcycles are also available to scout ahead of the convoi.
