====== Avena Village ======
Created Mittwoch 23 September 2015

Avena village is a small, isolated village at a side arm of mud river.
The people here are very active in plundering the ruins of ridgetown. What they can not put to use directly they stash and sell to roaming traders.
The denizens of this village must pass 3 trials to count as an adult or else be expelled from the village: 1. Stay awake for one night outside the village 2. Endure a painful ritual involving needles 3. Profession related.
The people of Avena village commonly have mutations and believe in the Stolen Eye religion, they do not have a shaman but they recognize bindings as gifts and curses in one.
They put a lot of efford into building a strong will, see trials.
They were plagued by the same problems the riverside dwellers are facing but fixed it by drinking only water from a spring in the mountains nearby.
People have seen strange sights in some buildings near the river.

The people of this village started as pilgrims from the wastes that went to see whom they consider to the [[World:Religions:WatchersOfDusk|Spiratas Sidereus]], **Giles Sa Vera**. Shedding the beliefs planted by **Iden Yamah** they found to the [[World:Religions:WatchersOfDusk|Watchers of Dusk]] which led them to Giles Sa Vera.
A big dissapointment set in when they realized **Giles Sa Vera** does not consider himself a messiah and has no interest in ever dealing with an unbound ever again. He outright denied their pleas to be served by them so they settled down upriver from the location he resides in and founded **Avena** Village.
