=== Core Belief ===
The religion of the stolen eye believes in a deity called the **Guardian of Nights Blackness, Backbone of the Night**. This deity is said to be the protector of the world that shields humans, their sleep and dreams with the veil of the divine.
In their lore the veil of the divine was ripped apart when the god that is sometimes also referred to as **Horus** was murdered by humans. With the veil gone they had the potential to see the world as it truly was and used this power to summon forth nightmares to gain their power.

=== Origin ===
The fact that this religion exists in many places in some shape or form speaks for formation during the early stages of the cataclysm while the world was more connected.
This time was then the book called **The Loss of Darkness, Apocalypticum** was spread around the world which later birthed this religion.
In its own lore it stems from the age old** Disciples of the guardian** which are said to date back thousands of years prior to the murder of god.

=== Organization ===
Loose organisation, most of it at the local level. Isolated communities of their faith may have changed versions of it that are accepted just aswell.

=== Acts of Worship ===
Prayer ceremonies to the guardian god, usually held around sunset, the watching of which is usually part of it. 
Commonly a night of sleep or waking meditation in the temple afterwards is added.
In some ceremonies people with bindings are specifically blessed and praised.

=== Holy Books and Artifacts ===
**The Loss of Darkness, Apocalypticum **is a printed book from the early days of the religion. It features the very roots of the religion and the explaination it can give to the at the all encompassing changes to the world happening at the time.
The day of its printing was already massively troubled and so the quality of completeness of the books is very low. Many churches have only parts of it, sometimes handwritten copies.
**Annotations considering ages to come **is a much newer book and deals with the issue of nightmares,mutants,binders and the **Spriatas Sidereus**. 

=== Fanatism ===
2/10

=== Ideals ===
Every nightmare in the world will have to be destroyed sooner or later, be it by the hands of the followers or by the messiah. The banishing of nightmares will accelerate the coming of the **Spiratas Sidereus** and make his sacrifice easier.
Mutants and the act of binding a nightmare are seen as a devout sacrifice, giving up part of ones humanity to in time destroy one more nightmare forever, the powers they get in exchange are in their view in no way a worthy compensation but the owner is allowed to completely use any advantage they might get out of their suffering. The people of this faith look bewildered upon the people that take bindings for the prospect of power but accept it, as it is still the right thing to do just for the wrong reasons.
In general people from this religion are told to not hastily judge people and be open minded.

=== Sins ===
Summoning forth further nightmares is seen as the only sin there is in the world and people accused of possessing this power are hunted with no mercy. This however is pretty rare as there are few people of such legendary power around.

=== Saints and other Religious Persons ===
The last act of the dieing god is said to be the promise of a saviour, the **Spiratas Sidereus** who will come forth and bind all nightmares left in the world to himself which he will take with him to oblivion on his death.

=== Place of Prayer ===
The place of gathering and prayer for this religion is called a **Hall of Dusk** or **Hall of Stars**. These are gloomy places with lots of black shrouds and star motifs covering the walls. 
Aside from the main gathering hall there are many tiny and secluded spaces for isolated worship.
Commonly the side spaces have shrines to **Spiratas Sidereus** and saints. 
In most cities the **Halls of Dusk/Stars** have arrangements that except them from being flooded by night lights.

=== Preachers ===
Called veiled or shrouded priests these preachers show their faces only at the end of ceremony during the **Universal Dawn** **Prayer**. During the ceremony they are never refered to by their name and instead called by the title of **Veil of Stars** which is also the name of the ceremonial clothing they wear.


=== Other streams of belief ===
This religion is very split up and since there is no central organisation the exact beliefs and rites have somewhat diverged. 

=== Phrases ===
"Starlight guide you" general blessing
"By your will we watch and wait" ending of prayers
"Mankind has lost(ruled) the sky once" a warning to be more humble
