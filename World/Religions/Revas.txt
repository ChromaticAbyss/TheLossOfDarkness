====== Revas ======
Created Montag 21 September 2015

=== Full Name ===
Children of Revas, the cradle of civilization, godess of progress and construction, comradry, birth, cycles, the seasons, reincarnation and bearer of the celestial spear.

=== Symbols ===
A golden, sometimes white spear.


=== Core Belief ===
There are many gods in the world, all of great power. None of them however deserves worship more than **Revas**, the cradle of civilisation. Without her no human civiliation would ever have existed and with her help a new permnent civilisation may yet come again to being.
Its not rare to see **Revas** worship mixed with worship of other gods, **Revas **portraied as a messiah figure of another faith or as part of a pantheon of other gods. 

=== Origin ===
The **Revas** cult originated from tribal societies that longed to once again form great nations and restore order to the world. It found a great fellowship in traders and mercenaries soon.
Mythologically **Revas** appeared to a now unkown tribe that inherited a great bandits realm and enemies. She helped these people forge alliances instead of continuing their dead elders ruinous path of isolation and hatred.

=== Organization ===
There are multiple independant organisations that worship **Revas** most importantly the **Mercenary-, Merchant-** and **Shadow Ritus**. All of these follow similar but not exactly identical procedures and interpretations.

=== Acts of Worship ===
Prayers can be found in one of many different prayer books that come for various rites and in various sizes.
A more important act of worship however is the doing of good deeds for the needy. Their honour code does not prevent them from taking payment for their services if the person looking for help could realistically afford it.

=== Holy Books and Artifacts ===
Shard of the celestrial spear

=== Fanatism ===
varies greatly by ritus (0-6)/10

=== Ideals ===
The main task of every acolyte of Revas is to restore civilization step by step.
They are supposed to strike down madness and inhumanity in whatever form they are encountered, for example a destructive unbound would be fought as well as a corrupt buisnessman, a well intentioned mutant however would not be harmed.

=== Sins ===
Anything that counteracts the restoration of civilisation for selfish reasons is considered a sin, not much else.

=== Saints and other Religious Persons ===


=== Place of Prayer ===
A buisy tradehouse, a mercenary headquarter, a kitchen for the needy in a slum or a hidden room in the metallic spires of the mighty are all places where one could expect a shrine to **Revas**. **Revas **doesn't have any single purpose temples as they serve no pupose furthering 
the goals, the primary purpose of the housing is glory enough to the faithful.

=== Preachers ===
A preacher for **Revas** could be pretty much anyone: A blind beggar, shrewd buisnessman, gritty mercenary or sivertongued mutant.

=== Other streams of belief ===
Countless 

=== Phrases ===
"As today, always" -Proverb said after a good/succesful day
