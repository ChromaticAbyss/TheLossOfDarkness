=== Core Belief ===
There are many gods in the world, all of great power. None of them however deserves worship more than **Revas**, the cradle of civilisation. Without her no human civiliation would ever have existed and with her help a new permnent civilisation may yet come again to being.
Its not rare to see **Revas** worship mixed with worship of other gods, **Revas **portraied as a messiah figure of another faith or as part of a pantheon of other gods. 

=== Origin ===
Mostly unknown historical and mythological knowledge:
In the occultism war, the large conflict where the science strand of conjuration fought and destroyed the occultism strand, **Revas** is said to have been a commander. Its not clear if she was merely there in mortal shape or if she reached deiety status on the closure of the conflict by using the 
**Coil of divine perception**, a component artifact made by the occultists to become part of the **Bridge of darkness, **together with **Ismaels Rod** and **The chain of Aldr**. While the leader of the enemy side **Ismael** **Voidshaper** defended the **Tesseractic Forge **in **Cereona, Revas **lead a sting operation to capture the
**Coil of divine perception **while it was to be delivered there. She was successful in her operation, but her ally **Vangj**, later called "the indescisive one" delayed his attack. **Ismael** used this time to fuse the two pieces he had, not reaching omnipotence but enough power to turn the rest of the war 
into a hellish slaughter. By the height of the war **Ismeal **and** Revas** killed each other. **Revas **is said to have used the **Coil** in her dieing moment and to have dissapeared in a flash of lighting, her voice and mind lingering in the ether to return after the end of the war and guide the survivors towards rebuilding civilisation 
on multiple occasions.


=== Organization ===
There are multiple independant organisations that worship **Revas** most importantly the **Mercenary-, Merchant-** and **Shadow Ritus**. All of these follow similar but not exactly identical procedures and interpretations.

=== Acts of Worship ===
Prayers can be found in one of many different prayer books that come for various rites and in various sizes.
A more important act of worship however is the doing of good deeds for the needy. Their honour code does not prevent them from taking payment for their services if the person looking for help could realistically afford it.

=== Holy Books and Artifacts ===
**Jesradits Standart**, a symbol of morals, courage and sacrifice. **Restoration of Civilization**, an unfinished book by Revas herself. Detailed toughts about how to restore civilisation after cataclysmic war.

=== Fanatism ===
varies greatly by ritus (0-6)/10

=== Ideals ===
The main task of every acolyte of Revas is to restore civilization step by step.
They are supposed to strike down madness and inhumanity in whatever form they are encountered, for example a destructive unbound would be fought as well as a corrupt buisnessman, a well intentioned mutant however would not be harmed.

=== Sins ===
Anything that counteracts the restoration of civilisation for selfish reasons is considered a sin, not much else.

=== Saints and other Religious Persons ===


=== Place of Prayer ===
A buisy tradehouse, a mercenary headquarter, a kitchen for the needy in a slum or a hidden room in the metallic spires of the mighty are all places where one could expect a shrine to **Revas**. **Revas **doesn't have any single purpose temples as they serve no pupose furthering 
the goals, the primary purpose of the housing is glory enough to the faithful.

=== Preachers ===
A preacher for **Revas** could be pretty much anyone: A blind beggar, shrewd buisnessman, gritty mercenary or silvertongued mutant.

=== Other streams of belief ===
Countless 

=== Phrases ===
"As today, always" -Proverb said after a good/successful day
