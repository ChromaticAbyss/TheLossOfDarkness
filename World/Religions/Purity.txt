====== Purity ======
Created Montag 21 September 2015

=== Full Name ===
The Chapter of Purity

=== Symbols ===

=== Core Belief ===
There once was a **guardian god** that shaped the world and protected it from the other, envious gods. However greedy humans made a pact with a dark god called **Leer** to banish **The Guardian**. After the heretic deed was completed he gave them the power to summon demons at the price of their souls.
The humans in their infinity greed used their new power to turn on each other turning the world into a blasted hellscape. The only hope to return **The Guardian** is to eradicate all faces of **Leer**, all that follow his teachings, all abominations that make a demon part of them and of course the demons themselves.
Only when the last of the demons is slain **The Guardian** will return and restore the world.

=== Organization ===
During the founding of old Arenna this was made the state religion and source of the ideals and politics of the ambitious nation. After the shattering of that nation refuges carried the religion of purity across the land where it took a foothold mostly in major cities.
The organisation is strictly hierarchic with the **Pontifex Rasas** of old Arenna being the highest instance. However with the shattering of Arenna and the death of the **Pontifex Rasas** and the **Council of Purity** dissappearing off the face of the planet the countrywide organisation was lost.
The next rank in the chain is the **Impensus Munditus**, or **High Cleanser** which are still appointed. Current **Impensus Munditus** of the Red Lakes is [[World:The Red Lakes:Oxygen City:Mercator Reddik|Mercator Reddik]], current **Impensus Munditus** of Lower Arenna is [         ].  A historical one was Kastan Firdust, the general of purity[TODO:Link].
The head of a **Cenotaph** is a **Munditus**, a temple servant or honoured layperson is an **Ordinator**. 

=== Acts of Worship ===
Prayer ceremonies to the guardian god, these are held by two different persons in two different roles. 
Dependant on the goals of the ceremony its a varying combination of instilling fear,hatred and hope.
These ceremonies are held once a day with military precision. 

=== Holy Books and Artifacts ===
**Apocalypticum, The Face of Nightmare ** is a printed book from the early days of the religion. The church of purity has reprints of it that are sacred relics. 
**The Divine Ward** is a huge booked filled with prayers and rules. It is present in every **Cenotaph**.

=== Ideals ===
Eradicate all faces of **Leer**, all that follow his teachings, all **abominations** that make a demon part of them and of course the demons themselves.
