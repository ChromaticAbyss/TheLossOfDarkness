These people believe that there is nothing inherently wrong with bindings and unbound and that they are just forces of nature that were merely released instead of being alien to this world.
As such all interactions with them are just interactions with the world in the same way you would chop a tree for firewood or defend against a hungry bear.
They aknowledge that some unbound are beings with agency that can be benevolent or malevolent, may need to be driven off like you would drive off a pack of wulves or may need to be appeased to or can be bargained with.
