Believ: The rapture has happened, nearly nobody was worthy, have to exercise in piety to remain sinless in purgatory where the seven deadly sins roam freely to go to heaven at the end.
They would never act violently against a mutant for no reason however as they believe everyone can be cleansed by exorcism and redeeming acts.
The symbol of the left behind is a simple triangle, sometimes it has the symbols of the three monotheistic religions that spawned it in each corner.

This is essentially a death cult that preaches personal morale over laws of any kind. Only god is allowed to judge people. Restricting people(imprisonment) is not accepted either, if a persons wrongdoing are so great that they can never be redeemed they should be killed at once. Killing or imprisoning a person
with forgivable sins will deny the possibilities both of further sin or redemption from them and is as such plain wrong.
