=== Full Name ===
The Left Behind

=== Symbols ===
A triangle, sometimes has the small symbols of the religions that spawned it inset in the corners.

=== Core Belief ===
The rapture has happened, nearly nobody was worthy.

Travelling preachers can be found nearly everywhere. No major chruces near the red bay area but they exist in other regions.

=== Acts of Worship ===
Prayers, rituals of cleansing

=== Holy Books and Artifacts ===
?

=== Fanatism ===
2/10

=== Ideals ===
This is essentially a death cult that preaches personal morale over laws of any kind. Only god is allowed to judge people. 

=== Sins ===
Restricting people(imprisonment) is not accepted either, if a persons wrongdoing are so great that they can never be redeemed they should be killed at once. 
Killing or imprisoning a person with forgivable sins will deny the possibilities both of further sin or redemption from them and is as such plain wrong.
Binding, they would never act violently against a mutant for no reason as they believe everyone can be cleansed by exorcism and redeeming acts.
Reproduction: Putting offspring into this hellish world and potentially sentencing them to eternal damnation is seen as a thing that should be avoided. All priests are forced to obey this, most other people go rather loose on this one.

Lust - Trickster

Greed - Kaelins Shard
Sloth - Drifter
Wrath - Berserk
Envy - Hydra/Pale Shade
Pride - Radiance
