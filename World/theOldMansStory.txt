====== Tell me a story ======
Created Montag 09 November 2015

Muffled sounds of gunshots resound from the shotting range beneath the **Bucket of Blood.** The outside of the estalishment formerly known as Lakeview hotel is lit by powerful spotlights that reveal a group of people collapsed around a table of playing cards and also an old and a young man at the next to it.
"So you belong to those guys over there, **mr. Vera**?" the old man starts up a conversation. The young man nods and then replies "i'm not big on those games of cards they play, i always preferred measuring my skill with the gun. A more substancial skill in these times".
Taking the last sip out of his glass the old man inquires "so why are you not down there at the range then? Name's **Jackson** btw". 
"**Albus Vera**. Got bored down there, after i beat them all no one wants to challenge me anymore and to be honest none of them should", Albus replied "had a knack for shooting since i was a little boy. Dad always said i'm too good of a shot to be in the military. He was right i guess, the life of a mercenary fits me much more".
**Jackson**, looking at his empty glas exclaims "i'm gonna go in and get us another round of drinks, next one is on you. I hope you can handle real man drinks". "Sure i do" **Albus** replies, lighting a smoke. As **Jackson** moves towards the building, **Albus** takes note of the old mans prostetic legs. Looking over to his snoring 
comerades he decides hes not gonna wake them before sunrise, maybe the old man will have a good war story to tell.

"Man that stuff burns" he caughs up after taking a large swig of the brown liquid. "As i said, man's drink", **Jackson** laughs**.** "Do you care to tell me how you lost you legs?" he asks, before taking another swig, a little less volumous than before.
"Surely can do my young man, seems we have enough time to pass", **Jackson **agrees, standing up and moving to the nearest spotlight. He fiddles with it for a second and it goes dark leaving them almost blind for a few seconds. 
Then their eyesight adapts and the unsteady light of the dancing Aurora above them reveals shapes far enough to orient. **Albus** gazes up to the vivid, dancing aurora above them as the old man returns to their seats. 
"Whats that for? Isn't this dangerous?" **Albus **wants to know, suddenly seeming less sure of himself. 
"Nah its fine as long as you are distracted. And it sets the mood nicely". And so the old man begins his story.

20 years ago when i was in much better shape i was a mercenary too you know. Not one of those fancy **white hawks** like you are, well equipped, organized and disciplined to a degree. We were a ragtag group of scoundrels working for whatever employer available. Our trio consisted of **Jason Sa Gadr**, **Vittoria Winter** and me **Gwennert Jackson**. We were tasked to find some specific microchips, for the **Bloodline** if my memory doesn't fail me. We had a similar contract before where about a month of searching and asking around led us to an old factory. It had a name that included a word i didn't understand and ended on "..industries", a multi story building full of old machinery and weird plastic rooms, located in a given up industrial outskirt not all too far from the **white water river**. I still remember the fight that broke out with a rival scavenger group the first time that ended with one of the seriously injured and then us talking out a compromise. We got to scour the upper two floors and they got the lower floor and basement. The first time we got all of the microchips we could use and then some in about a days worth of time. We checked on the camp of the others and found only the wounded guard that was quite concerned due to no news from his colleagues. Back in the day we just thought they might have gotten lost in there, even the situation beeing some kind of trap for us floated around for a while. We decided to leave with what we had and never heard from any of them again.
So the second time we went there we didn't notice anyone to not attract further attention and safe for a small incident with an exploding centipede the travel was just as easy as the first time. **Vittoria **certainly had a talent for getting us to places quickly. 
When we arrived at that freakish factory we of course knew that the upper floor would have little left of what we needed so we turned to the lower floor.
The blackness in the large building was total, unlike in the upper floors where parts of the roof were missing. Only equipped with flashlights we searched the floor.
The first thing that struck us as odd was the two large bags of loot we found in one of the central corridors. By the decay it showed we determined that it was probably from that other scavenger group, not as old as the complex. 
Normally nobody sane would leave behind two large bags of potentially valuable microchips and metals so we knew something bad happened to that other group. 
Even more on edge than before we scanned around for signs of combat or corpses but could find none. We looked through the contents of the bags and found a few of the circuits we wanted but some damaged and by far not enough to make this trip worth it.
Carefully we searched for more in the ground level but it seemed picked clean of interesting things. At that point **Jason** noted a heavy metal hatch that when we lifted it with our combined forces revealed a stairwell leading to the basement.
It was decided that **Jason** was to stand guard at the hatch because we were not sure we could lift it from below should it fall for some reason. 

When me and **Vittoria** entered the basement the darkness seemed even more absolute down here, easily swallowing the thin light cones of our flashlights. Carefully we inched around each corner moving as silently as possible. Motes of dust rose with every of our steps and settled again like snowflakes.
Another corner and my heart nearly stopped as the cone of my flashlight strafed a pale thin siluette at the end of a long corridor. **Vittoria** saw it too, aiming her light at it. It didn't move, just standing motionlessly in the distance. I used the scope on my rifle to get a better view and realised someone had 
painted the figure onto the wall with white paint. The gloomy atmosphere still lingered, we were unsure what to make of this figure. It was obviously painted at some later point, likely by the previous group of scavengers.
Just as we had again set in motion an inexplicable and potent rush of ice cold air flooded the tunnels, accompanied by an unearthly sound barring any description. I picked up the flashlight i had dropped in panic and realised **Vittoria** was gone. I whispered her name, panic overwhelming me when i saw 
another nearly human siluette. Not wanting to try if it was just another painting or an actual malevolent creature i started running in a random direction until my flashlight flickered out. 

I had no idea where i was. Complete darkness all around me  i held onto the wall for at least some orientation. I let go of the walls whenever distant noises swelled up and ducked for cover. I popped another **Ice **to get at least some control over myself, grasped my combat knife firmly and followed the wall once more.
I tought i was saved when a i saw a light around a corner and called out for **Vittoria,** no answer. As i approached i realised it was light coming from below a thin steel door that was oddly free of dust.
Thinking that i might have found an exist from this nightmare i ripped it open. To my dissapointment there was only a storage hall behind it, lit by steadily burning neon lights.
It didn't step into that hellish room for reasons i don't remember i stopped for a second. A second was long enough for a massive surge of vertigo and nausea to overcome me. I stepped back a bit and realised that the room while looking completely normal from the point of the doorway it was bizzarely warped.
Dropping my knife in there revealed that the ground was far from flat and instead a steep drop into a bottomless abyss toward what appeared to be a wall at first sight. I reached for the door handle to shut this accursed door once and for all but couldn't do so before noticing a small group of pale white siluettes walking along what from the doors persepective would have been the side of a shelf. Maybe not even tiny, just far away. After closing the door i collapsed to the wall opposite of it and lost consciousness. For how long i cannot say.
When i regained my senses i got onto my shaking legs i started moving again, this time probing the darkness before me with my rifle on every step. I do not know how long i was in there but after a long time i saw the hatch we entered through. Suddenlly something popped out from my peripheral vision, a pale white creature without a face rushed towards me. I fired my rifle more out of reflex than any kind of consicous tought. It jammed. The creature tackled me to the ground and i reached for my knife, realising too late that i didn't even have it anymore. 
As i looked again at the creature i realised it was Jason, only his eyes were completely gone, grown over with skin. He was crying and i started screaming and backed away. 
Seeing him stumble around blindly and realising i nearly shot my comerade nearly shattered my mind. He was blind and talking mindlessly but otherwise he seemed unchanged.
Gathering my courage I popped another three Ice and then got the courage to give him one as well, then ascended the stars slowly, guiding him.

A while later he told me that we were down there for two whole days. He guarded the hatch when he heard something from below which he believed to be **Vittoria**. He jammed the hatch shut and wen't down. What he saw down there he describes as a thin, completely white figure holding a white mask in front of its face. The mask he could describe in lots of detail while the creature seemed to not have any detail at all. The he describes the figure slowly removing its mask and fading into nothingness while doing so, along with his vision. 
We left the building immediately, nighttime or not, got two hours worth of walking distance between us and that accursed building before taking a small rest. None of us could even think of sleeping at that time so we left shortl after.
Back in Lithium city we consulted a surgeon which tried to cut away the skin from **Jasons** eyes but after a day it was grown back. As we visited the doctor again he just told us that "hes not gonna treat no damn mutie". I assured **Jason **that we would try another surgeon. One night later he was gone without a trace.
Nobody has heard or seen of him before but most people just assume he wandered out into the woods and died there.

 **Albus** takes another sip from his drink. The sun is slowly rising, pushing away the aura that dominated the night sky. "One more thing", **Albus** asks "How did you lose your legs in that story?". "Oh i didn't", the old man replied. "I lost my legs half a year later while loading oil barrels onto a ship. One got loose and just maimed my legs. Not as much of a story i guess". " Agreed " exclaimes **Albus** while watching his comerades wake up and stretch. One of them gestures **Albus** to come over "leave that old man in peace, i gotta tell you about this weird ass dream i just had".
