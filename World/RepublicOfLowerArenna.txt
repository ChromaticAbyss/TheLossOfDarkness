====== RepublicOfLowerArenna ======
Created Sonntag 13 September 2015

The Republic of lower Arenna(ROLA) once was part of the now splitered nation of Arenna. Since its separation it exists in a war ravaged state, each conflict with its neighbours tainting the soil more and more until the land was unable to sustain its population.
A large group of settlers was cast to walk up the coastline and settle any fertile land they might find. The crossed an area of rocky ravines now called The Push and after difficult travels found fertile land along a clear river. 
This river was damned and the land settled after driving back the locals. Conflict arose quickly and requests for help to the ROLA fell on deaf ears. Years after the Red Lake Autonomy fouded with little resistance from the ROLA that was occupied with other problems.

From time to time trades and mercenaries travel across The Push to conduct trade but any attempts to create stable infrastructure through The Push were underfunded and doomed to fail against the wild nature of the landscape.
The red lake autonomy currently tries to dam up another nearby valley in the push for expansion purposes.
