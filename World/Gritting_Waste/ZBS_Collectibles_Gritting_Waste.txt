====== ZBS Collectibles Gritting Waste ======
Created Friday 25 December 2015

The gritting waste is almost completely devoid of plant and animal life which makes survival for a stranded person really challenging.
The area is also severely lacking in drinkable water which only collects in a few rusty pools. The water from the hot springs and ironclad rivers is not drinkable.

=== Zoology(Hunting) ===
Bird(mostly large birds that fly over the area from time to time)


=== Botanics ===
While there are some plant like outgrowths of the gritting waste that may be of interest for someone that knows Botanics, none of them do even resemble food.


=== Scavenging ===
Vehicle wrecks litter the waste or roam it in unending torment. Only the most sturdy of things will still be recognizable.
