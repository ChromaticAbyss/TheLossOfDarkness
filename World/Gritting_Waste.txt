====== Gritting Waste ======
Created Sonntag 25 Oktober 2015

The **Gritting Waste** is a vast area that separates the red lake area from the yamahian tribes area. 
Aside from occasional travellers not much lives in this area filled with rusty crumbs, reddish dust and dark briny pools with an oil like feel to them.
Interesting landmarks are old warmachine wreckage, strange metallig spires that grow over years from the rust only to decay within days for no apparent reason and boiling pools spawning small streams that run in iron riverbeds.
The wind carries with it dissonant voices in the form of battlecries, shouted orders, roar of guns and screams of agony. From time to time the wind arranges the sand into strange patterns that are as weird as they are short lived.
Some places also commonly manifest silluettes of warriors, mutants or tanks.
Aside from the dangers to the mind these cause the area is also dangerous to the body by basically being a desert that offers no food or drink. Its also pretty common to have to replace ones footwear after an extended travel in here if not way more of ones equipment.



Around the waste the tribes of yamah build small shrines that are supposed to stop the snail paced growth of the waste and also serve as a pilgrimage site. It is common to see these shrines partially eaten away by the rust or vandalized in the areas that face away from the tribal territory while those inside it 
are well kept and stocked with [[Items:Healing And Drugs:Thunder|Thunder Candles]].

=== Inhabitants ===
[[Unbound:Tainted Embers|Tainted Embers]] (unbound), a small manifestation of rust and decay
[[Unbound:Grinder Phantom|Rust Storm]] (unbound), a large storm of swirling rust and metal. This is a decayed tormented steel entity.
