=== Scavenging ===
A lot of things can be found in the clustered ruins rising above the surface. Everything above the surface has probably been already found by someone else before and been repurposed/ used up/ thrown away, 
Digging is a more time consuming option that may pay off in certain areas.
Very proficient scavengers may also hunt down stashes of other scavengers but this poses a risk.
