====== Agnared ======
Created Mittwoch 16 Dezember 2015

The sharded hills predominantly feature completely eroded cityscapes with only occasional clusters of somewhat intact buildings. Certain areas however have weathered the tides of time better than others, forming large dead landscapes of manmade infertility.
A particularly well preserved tower within such an area was chosen by the [[World:Persons:Iden Khonsu|Iden Khonsu]] as his residence, completely disregarding the fact than the town is infested with the insane and completely identical clones of one poisonous [Change Link][[Binding:Hydra|hydra mutant]].
The followers of the Iden have built their town around his residence, growing steadily for each group of followers gained by him. To gather materials for construction and scavenging and to improve the safety of the town one potential mutant hideout after the other is
demolished and turned to scraps. 

The high presence of warriors in this city leads to common agression in the maze like city which is sometimes taken to the arena in front of the town but not always. 
Aside from agression an everpresent paranoia lingers in the many floors of this city, secrets are gathered religiously and can sometimes replace any currency, Secrets are also offered at certain shrines spread all over the townseemingly randomly.
All of the shrines are pedestrals made of orange, smooth stone that have seemingly random items on them. These items may never be touched and will be spoken to in whispers when alone. It is said that the shrines grant luck, other secrets or even 
actual miracles to the devot. The offering of one secret is mandatory for every person that first visits the town for the first time tough there is no one in the room to check on what actually happens.



=== Population ===
~3000, most of them in working age, many warriors

=== Location ===
A large city ruin that borders the Sharded Hills

=== Notables ===
The city is centred around a surprisingly stable old building. All other buildings are way lower and build recently from the rubble  of other old buildings. Around this complex is a large zone where all old buildings have been demolished.
Agnared has a huge facility for sorting rubble, a blast furnace and a hall where armed vehicles are maintained. One building houses the "secret" project of the [[World:Persons:Iden Khonsu|Iden,]] the restoration of an old age heavy tank that makes absolutely no progress.
The city itself is **not illuminated** at night, only the guard posts are. Most of the city is safe however because the **sky is visible only from a few spots** and most people have no reason to be alone outside at night.
Near the city is a large pit with a labyrinthine interior, covered with heavy glass panes. It is used as an **arena** that pitches criminals and gladiators against captured scorpion mutants, or against each other. Spectators can walk above the glass for a top down 
view of the spectacle. 

=== Religion ===
A weird religion based around confession and trade of secrets, with weird, seemingly mundane objects(box of matches,glass,walkie talkie,handgun) on shrines.
Its demanded from every visitor that they offer a secret on entering the town.

=== Connections ===
Nearly all exits of the surrounding cityscape place the traveller in the sharded hills, it is over these roads the city is supplied with food and new recruits. 
A few paths take the traveler to the nearby mountains which seem to be infested with anthrophages aswell.

=== Government ===
[[World:Persons:Iden Khonsu|Iden Khonsu,]] who holds together the whole town.
A few high ranking supporters of his also have a lot of say while he is unavailable.
