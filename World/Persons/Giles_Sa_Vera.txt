====== Giles Sa Vera ======
Created Mittwoch 07 Oktober 2015

Giles is a man of about 40 years that has an eerie aura of power surrounding him. He lives in a gas refinery near Mud River, the gas of which he burns out to satisfy his immense pyromania. 

In his past he was one of the most sucessfull [[Abilities:Binding|binders]] in the entrie [[World:The Red Lakes:Bloodline|Bloodline]] controlled part of the [[World:The Red Lakes|Red Lake Autonomy]]. He earned lots of credits via exorcisms and contracted bindings for wealthy people that wanted the one or other ability but none of the mutations.
This lasted until he became a victim of his own success when a group of people from the council appeared before him and made him the sweetest of offers.
He was to banish the monstrosity known as the **pyroclasm** that was unleashed when Giles was only a little child and raged to this very point. In response he was promised everything he would ever need should he succeed.
The man in a fluke of arrogance accepted and went out to bind the **pyroclasm** to himself, a decision he had a whole decade to regret.
While in constant pain and drawn to flame like a moth to the light he has now become an ashen shadow of his former self, with power beyond compare though. 
Giles is afraid of ever having to unleash his powers and of what that would do to him, he also has zero interest in ever doing any binding related work ever again. 
He is also not sure if the **pyroclasm** might survive its hosts death and roam free once again so the council forced him the wear an [[Items:Healing And Drugs:Animoplasm|animoplasm]] injector at all times.

If a character manages to befriend Giles they might have a reluctant **teacher** for the Art of [[Abilities:Binding|Binding]] that will with every lesson point out that it is not worth using this ability for any kind of gain. 
If a character manages to wake Giles hatred, they will quickly end up as a feint breeze of ash in the air.

A lot of people of [[World:Religions:WatchersOfDusk|Watchers of Dusk faith]], especially in [[World:Wilderness:Avena Village|Avena Village]] see him as their messiah figure [[World:Religions:WatchersOfDusk|Spiratas Sidereus]], something he isn't interested at all in being.
