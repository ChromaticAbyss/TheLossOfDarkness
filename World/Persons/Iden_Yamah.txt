====== Iden Yamah ======
Created Sonntag 30 August 2015

Iden was a person of overwhelming power with a gaze that no mortal or spirit could withstand.
Under more knowledgable persons he is known as one of the last summoners in the world.
Hand of the vortex, one biologically one bionic?
Wielded the Bridge of Darkness (steampunk/hypertechnology/arcane staff that allows summoning) 
He united countless tribes of the wastes and turned them into mutants powerful enough to hold and even expand their territory despite being technologically inferior.
