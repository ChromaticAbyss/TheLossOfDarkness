====== Vis Sy Tennet ======
Created Donnerstag 27 August 2015

The shady and secretive Vis rarely shows much of himself but is known to be a highly intelligent person with extensive scientific knowledge.
It is said that he has a huge array of Bionic augmentations especially to the brain, so much even that some call him an artifical intelligence with a few meat parts attached.
A saying in Cin Con Caph calls him "the deadliest man in the world with a spreadsheet", which s a reference to the fact that he basically organizes the entire Bloodline himself, 
calculating resouce levels, troop movements, production requirements and diplomatic factors with incredible insight and accuracy.

Vis has agents in most cities that have Neurouplinks installed and compile their memory once a month to send to him in form of a VSM(Link). 
Neither of these agents has much information to be extorted from them tough and most are somewhat expendable.

Zar Es Veka - A ususally drunk or drugged hobo in Silicium City, has no knowledge that he is being used. People are somewhat afraid of him and commonly are generous towards him without knowing what exactly is up with him.
Colonel Vicktus - A military officer from Lithium City provides insider information in exchange for some easy successes in the field.
Mar Sy Jin - An arms merchant from Carbo City that illegally sells bloodline weapons under the cover of regular buisness. This person is a somewhat important bridgehead and has maybe the most extensive insider knowledge of all these persons.
Leoris Weatherfray - A somewhat popular mutant in the slums in front of Oxygen city that serves to observe and manipulate the mood in there.
