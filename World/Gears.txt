A popular game among mercenaries. This is a card game with one or more gears printed on each as well as additive(+0,+1,+2) or multiplicative points(x0,x2,x3) or an engine(positive or negative start direction, - gives points usually).

Each player has a deck of 15 cards that is customizable pre game.

Cards can be played face down if they have +0 or x0. 

Card types:

Gears(x2,x3)
Reverser(Reverse,+0)

Certain inns also hand out special versions of these cards so a deck can sometimes tell quite a lot about the owner.
