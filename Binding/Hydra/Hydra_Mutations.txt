====== Hydra Mutations ======
Created Tuesday 28 July 2015

The Hydra Binding and the Hydra Medicine can both cause similar mutations. The special thing about Hydra is the vast amount of chaotic mutations that can occur.
There are two tables here: Small and Serious mutations, on a prompt roll a D20 and look up the respective table.

If there is any talk of a "zone" it means the zone the medicine was appplied to, a wound was healed from or a randomly determined zone.
These mutations usually deveop over the course of a month but may appear much faster in the context of a fresh binding.

[Small]
1. Nothing happens
2. Weird Skin: The skin around one zone of the body takes on a destinct, gross loking colour and texture. This may grant you a negative modifier to social skills if seen by a person that dislikes mutants.
3. ^
4. Weird crawling: A weird crawling feeling within the flesh that is most noticable during attempted relaxation. Grants a -1 modifier to the Meditation skill.
5. ^
6. Oozing: Zone produces weird black ooze at all times which may be hard to conceal.
7. ^
8. Black Spirit: Thin black tentacles grow from the body zone. These move on their own, sometimes attempting to snatch and consume small animals that pass by them.
9. ^
10. ^ 
11. ^
12. Rapid Hair Growth (in that zone)
13. Extreme Fertility(Zone irrelevant): The character is extremely fertile but tends to produce heavily mutated children.










[Serious]
1. Roll a small Mutation instead
2. ^ 
3. Black Spirit: Longer and thicker tentacle growth. If you expend 1 plasticity you can learn to use them like a limb, otherwise they move on their own like described above. Zone counts as [[Bionics|mutated]].
4. ^
5. ^
6. ^
7. ^
8. Deformed: The respective zone is heavyly deformed, this counts as a permanent wound on that position, also as a [[Bionics|mutated]] zone.
9. ^
10. ^ 
11. ^
12. ^
13. ^
14. Duplicate: If the respective zone is a limb it grows a duplicate. This duplicate can be used normally if you expend 1plasticity. The new limb counts as mutated. If the zone is Torso an insternal organ duplicates and squishes the other organs(-1 max Vitality, torso mutated). On the head this may be an extra eye, mouth etc.(-2 social skills,-1 max stability head mutated)
15. ^
16. ^
17. ^
18. General decay: Chose a random unmutated zone on the body. This zone is now [[Bionics|mutated]] by lots of tiny changes. Also you lose -1 max Vitality or Stability (your choice)
19. General decay: Chose a random unmutated zone on the body. This zone is now [[Bionics|mutated]] by lots of tiny changes. Also you lose -1 max Vitality or Stability (your choice)
20. Roll two serious hydra mutations, one for this zone and one for an adjacent one.
