====== Berserk ======
Created Friday 26 June 2015

An entity of pure rage is bound within the character. When unleashed it turns the character into a primal beast that feels no pain and fights tooth and nail until every hostile(or thing they think of as hostiles) is dead.

=== Binding Process ===
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-2)

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+2)  
		**No pain receptors:** You don't ever get to see your characters Hp without spending 2 Actions checking yourself for wounds. Even then you wont notice any internal wounds. You never take any penalties due to pain.

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+5)  
		**Unintelligible Rage:** While **Berserking** you can only scream and produce animalistic sounds, not form words.


[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Hard difficulty (+0)
		**Berserk:** If your [[Glow]] is 10 or higher and you are in a combat situation you immediately activate **Berserk**. The glow cost still applies and the cast check automatically fails should one be needed.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Hard difficulty (+0)
		**Numbness:** You take a tenth of you [[Glow]] amount as damage to your Stability, as all your regular senses push into the background.

=== Low Stability ===
Memories of Pain flood back into the characters mind blotting out all courage: -2 Willpower, -1 all other Attributes. No painkiller or anything will alleviate this pain for the duration. The character also has a chance to enter Berserker Rage when provoked (roll a D20 on the comparative severity) which lasts at least 5 turns of combat. The taunting person is the hostile as well as everyone assisting or trying to sperate the fight.
