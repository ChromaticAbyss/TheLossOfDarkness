====== Hydra ======
Created Monday 29 June 2015



Note: Related to the item [[Items:Healing And Drugs:Animoplasm|Animo/HydraPlasm]] which has a distorted and diluted version of this creature. Hydra is very volatile and loves to find hosts to infect so it will not be found as an [[Unbound]]. If a character for any reason wants this binding they need to find an unbroken binding containment that has a Hydra(which is rare) or inject themselves with a lot of [[Items:Healing And Drugs:Animoplasm|Hydraplasm]].






**Binding Process:** 
[[Binding|Stability]]: Hard difficulty (+0)


[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+0)  
		**Reshaping Flesh**: Roll a serious mutation from the [[Binding:Hydra:Hydra Mutations|Hydra mutations]] table. 
		Once a year roll a **Hard** Resistance check and on failure repeat this process.

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+0)  
	**          Changed Flesh**: Roll two small mutations from the [[Binding:Hydra:Hydra Mutations|Hydra mutations]] table. 

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Hard difficulty (+0)
		**Continuus Decay:** If the triggering ability was a Hydra ability, roll a small mutations from the [[Binding:Hydra:Hydra Mutations|Hydra mutations]] table(if you have more than 30 [[Glow]] roll a serious one instead).  If it wasn't you just lose [[Glow]] / 10 Vitality.
		**Special Rule**: No maximum of entries.


[[Binding|Amalgamation]]: Hard difficulty



=== Specialisations/Casts ===
**Enhanced Healing**
[Starting Cast]
Glow: 8 , 1 Actions
Start a healing surge that lasts [[BindingMastery]] turns and restores 2 Vitality each turn.
	
**Rapid Adaption**
Cost: 3 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 5
Glow: X * X, 2 Actions
Quickly adapts the body for a specific task involving the attributes Burst, Dexterity or Endurance(rarely useful because most such tasks exceed the duration).
The potency can be freely chosen as X but can not exceed half your [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery.]]
Lasts [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery]] + X * 2 minutes, the bonus can be used as many times as needed during the duration but only for the chosen Ability/Attribute combo.

**Close Wound**
Cost: 5 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 5
Passive
If a Healing Surge reaches turn 5 you may remove a wound of your choice. This will increase your Glow by 4 additional points (roll again for Cast).
This effect can be used another time at reaching turn 10.
You can also roll your regular wound healing checks in 1 day shorter intervals and with a +2 bonus passively.

		
**Lifeguard**
Cost: 3 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 5
Passive
When you drop to 0 or below you automatically cast **Enhanced Healing** to start a **Healing Surge**. The [[Glow]] costs are applies and Cast check automatically fails.
Yes this can make it extremely hard to kill you.
However the downside is everytime this triggers you have to roll for Hydra Mutations similarly to using the respective medicine.

**Bioweapon** 
Cost: 5 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 7
Glow: 8 , 1 Actions
Grants a temporary additional/shape shifted limb that serves as a powerful weapon.
It is used via hand to hand and deals 1D6+1 damage.
Lasts [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery]] minutes.
This ability can be purchased multiple times, each time the cost goes up by 1 PP, chose one effect on each purchase. These can stack, see the (+) symbol for which stats will increase.
* Hand to Hand skill modifier of +1 (+)
* Damage +1 (+) 
* Poison: If you inflict a wound you apply a poison that deals 1(+) damage every turn of combat for 5 turns.


=== Low Stability ===
**Flesh over Mind**: The character obtains a small mutation each hour unless a Willpower check is passed(keep in mind the -1 for being below 5 Stability) if a mutation is obtained this way restore 2 Stability.
