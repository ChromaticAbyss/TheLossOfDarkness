**Binding Process:** 
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Distorted Spacial Awareness**: To this character things commonly appear much closer than they are (-2 modifier to Pathfinding,Shooting,Throwing weapons, Reflexes).
		
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+5)  
**Distanced**: The character always appears a little further away than it should be, even at almost touching distance it feels like they are about a metre away. 
-1 to Hand to Hand for this character and against this character, -1 to hitting the character with throwing or shooting weapons, -1 modifier to all dexterity skill checks as the character somtimes has to stretch more than expected to grab something.
		

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Strange Gravitation:** Dust,Snow,Pebbles and Small Insects gravitate to the character from [[Glow]] metres away with a strength that also depends on the [[Glow]]. This effect lasts for [[Glow]] turns and makes the character very easy to spot.
Can have additional downsides depending on what you attract and how much of it.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Distorted Spacial Awareness:** See the mutation, lasts for [[Glow]] minutes. Stacks additively with the mutation.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Connectome:** All characters that have bindings within [[Glow]] metres gain +3 [[Glow]] (no Cast check needed).

**Telekinesis**
[Starting Cast]
Glow: 4 ,1 Action
You have up to [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery]] turns of combat where you can manipulate objects less than 1kg heavy by slowly moving them. The force behind this movement is too weak to pry somthing from someones hand or serve as a weapon.
The object must stay within [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery]] metres of you at all times. You can juggle up to 3 objects this way.

**Projected Force**
Cost: 3 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 4
Glow: 1 ,1 Action
Use your Binding to deliver a physical strike onto a target in vision that is [[BindingMastery:|BindingMastery]] metres or less away. This attack deals the damage you would deal unarmed.
This can of course also be used to shatter objects at a distance.
