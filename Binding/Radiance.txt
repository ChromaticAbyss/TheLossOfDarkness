[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+0)  
**Burn marks**: Leaves painful and permanent burn marks at the spot where it entered the body. -1 maximum Vitality. 
		
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Burn marks**: Leaves painful and permanent burn marks at the spot where it entered the body. -1 maximum Vitality. 
**Special rule**: Does not get +5 if the above mutation is obtained.

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Hard difficulty (+0)  
**Radiation Source:** The host body now produces considerable amounts of radiation, not enough to be an acute health hazard for those around him but definitily detectable with a geiger counter. You gain 1 dSv every 2 days(which effectively reduces your normal regeneration by 0.5 on average).

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Hard difficulty (+0)
**Gamma Flare:** You start emitting gamma rays for [[Glow]] minutes. This deals 1D3 dSv to every organic thing within 5 metres per turn of combat(see Searing Aura for a similar but stronger effect). This one includes yourself.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Gamma Burst:** You emit a powerful gamma ray burst that deals [[Glow]]/3 [[CombatRules:DamageTypes:Radiation|radiation damag]]**e** to every organic thing within 5 metres. Again this includes yourself.


[[Binding|Amalgamation]]: Hard difficulty


=== Specialisations/Casts ===
**Radiant Aura**
[Starting Cast]
Glow: 5, 1 Actions
For [[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]] turns of combat: Per turn of combat everyone within 10 metres (and not shielded by a wall, lead etc.) takes 1D3 Radiation Damage. 1D6 against targets closer than 5metres. This does **NOT** include yourself.

**Radiation ** **Resistance**
Cost: 5 PP, Requires BindingMastery: 4
Passive
Grants 2 points aof Radiation Armor that even work against internal sources.
Also it takes 4 **dSv** for you to be **radiation sick** instead of 1.


**Radiant Ray:** 
Cost: 6 PP, Requires BindingMastery: 8
Glow: 7 , 1 Actions
Bombard a single target within 12 metres with gamma rays, dealing 1D6+[[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]]/2 Radiation Damage. This counts as an **easy** ranged attack.
This beam pierces all light substances, the only things that massively shield it is water, lead etc. 
However its usually not possible to aim it properly through walls.

		
**X-Ray Vision	:      **
Costs: 10PP, Requires BindingMastery: 3
Glow: 5, 1 Action
Sends out a harmless pulse of X-rays and uses their reflections to get an image of the whole surroundings. X-rays penetrate most walls, revealing a sphere with a radius of your [[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]] under normal circumstances (think house not bunker with lead walls).
To see smaller details a Perception skill check may be needed.
After the pulse is over this kind of vision lasts for your [[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]] in turns of combat, it is useless however without any source of x-rays such as the sun or some radiactive material(or yourself being a radiactive emitter due to mutation).
			

=== Low Stability ===
**Radiant Beyond**: You obtain 1 [[Glow]] per hour(no Cast checks required) also one Decisievert. The radiation is also taken for everyone that spends that hour mostly within 10 metres. You also visibly glow.
