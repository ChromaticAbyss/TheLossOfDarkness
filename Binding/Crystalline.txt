====== Crystalline ======
Created Wednesday 24 June 2015

A crystalline entity is bound with this lifeform, able to harden the flesh to the strength of granite in an instant. A more prolific owner may be able to harden only certain parts, passively have armored skin or produce crstalline spikes for use as a weapon.




[[ProgressPoints|PP]]-cost on character generation: 20


**Binding Process:** 
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+2)  
**Cristallized Skin**: The characters skin has interwoven crystalline filaments. The thus hardened skin grants the character a 1 point Armor when he otherwise would have 0. However this skin isn't very flexible(-1 modifier to Reflexes, Sprint and Obstacle) and looks a little odd.
Skin counts as [[Bionics|mutated]].
		
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+2)  
**Cristalline Keratin:** Nails and hair of this character are made from crystalline substance. The hair usually breaks off at a short length due to being inflexible. The nails however are actually very useful (+1 damage in unarmed combat), they are however a real pain to cut.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Crystalline Stasis:** If your [[Glow]] is 10 or higher you are unable to act for one turn of combat (+1 per full 10 [[Glow]] from then on)
**Special Rule**: Maximum 2 entries.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Crystalline Reflections:** Gain 3 [[Glow]], roll another Cast check of the respective difficulty to see if the Burn Table fires again from this.
	  
[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Crystalline Memory:** It will take 12 hours from now on before your [[Glow]] will start decaying.
	
[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Crystalline Cage:** If you have 30 or more [[Glow]] you lose 1D6 [[ProgressPoints]] (PP) from your [[Attributes|Dexterity]] Attribute, even breaking up a point if necessary.
	

[[Binding|Amalgamation]]: Normal difficulty
