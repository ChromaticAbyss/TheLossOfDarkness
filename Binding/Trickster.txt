====== Trickster ======
Created Thursday 25 June 2015

										"Don't deal with a trickster, you can only lose..."

A manipulative entity that is only known to bind to to humans.

[[ProgressPoints|PP]]-cost on character generation: 20


**Binding Process:** 
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+3)  
**Split tongue**: -1 modifier to perception checks that deal with taste. No downsides regarding speech.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Dancing illumination:** Dancing lights surround you, lasting for as many turns of combat as you have [[Glow]]. This makes Stealth basically impossible for the duration.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Distracting Presence:** A presence that manifests near the edges of your vision and with barely audible whispers distracts you for as many turns of combat as you have [[Glow]]. This results in a -1 modifier to everything you do for the duration.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+5)
**Unnerving Presence:** Same as **Distracting Presence** except that it affects your **allies** within 10 metres and **not you**.

[[Binding|Amalgamation]]: Normal difficulty



=== Specialisations/Casts ===
**Silver Tongue** 
[Starting Cast]
Glow: 5 , 0 Actions(when promted)
Using this Cast you can add your [[BindingMastery|Mastery]] to a single Fast Talk skill check. 
		
**Intrigue**:  
Cost: 3 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 4		
Passive
You may cast **Silver Tongue** on negotiation checks. 
If you want you can also replace your actual Negotiation skill with half of your Fast Talk skill in that instance.
		
**Dazzle**:  
Cost: 6 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 3		
Cast: Glow: 7, 1 Action
Attempts to confuse and stun a thing with a brain. You duel your [[BindingMastery]](normal check) against their Willpower(normal check). If you succeed the target is stunned for one turn of combat.
In parallel to casting Dazzle you can perform any Move/Chase or Cover action but not cast something else or attack. This property makes **Dazzle** good for getaways but less useful in direct combat (unless you brough allies).
Range: [[BindingMastery]] in metres.
		
**Greater Confusion:** 
Cost: 7 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 7, **Dazzle**		
Cast: Glow 18, 1 Action
Works like Dazzle except that it targets any person you want within [[BindingMastery]] metres. Not only does this stun groups it also stuns for 2 Turns instead of one.
This is again useful for escaping groups of people or to initiate a fight.
 In parallel to casting Greater Confusion you can perform any Move/Chase or Cover action but not cast something else or attack
		
**Magic Trick**:  
Cost: 2 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 3		
Cast: Glow: 1, 1+ Action
Performs one or a series of "street magic" tricks. A good way to entertain guests or earn a little money in a city.

**Tricksters Contract:** 
Cost: 5 PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 6
Cast: Glow 10, 1 Handshake
Cast this upon making a contract sealed with a sign, stam, handshake etc.
Whenever your victim tries to break the contract(they can only try once a day) they must do a a duel against you: Your [[BindingMastery]](normal check) against their Willpower(normal check)(use the Willpower value you had when making the contract) if they fail they are bound by the 
words of the  contract.  If they win a duel they can break it. 
Just thinking about breaking the contract does not count as a try btw.
**Note:** You can break your end of the bargain at any time you want(you are a trickster after all), doing so removes the effect from your victim though.



=== Low Stability ===
**Babylon:** The character loses the ability to communicate with language be it written or spoken. Basic gestures still work.
