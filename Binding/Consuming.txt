=== Specialisations/Casts ===

**Gluttony** 
[Starting Cast]
Glow: 5 , at least 1 hour
Start consuming excessive amounts of food to bring your body into overdrive. You must at least consume 5 meals worth of food, you can however eat more to have the effect last longer.
You gain 2 + one per meal worth of food you at over 5 stacks of **Gluttony**.  If you reach 5 stacks of **Gluttony** this way you instantly regenerate 3 Vitality.
These fall off at a rate of 1 per day unless you eat an additional meal that day, if you dont eat your basic intake you lose the respective amount of stacks in addition.
While you have any stacks of **Gluttony** you regenerate 1 additional Vitality each day even when not resting, you maximum Vitality is increased by your **Gluttony**.
While you have more than 5 stacks of **Gluttony** you suffer from the effects of the **Fat** mutation if you don't have it already.
		
**Instant Gratification** 
Costs: 4PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 4
Cast: Glow: 5, 1 Action
Instantly gulp down a meal which doesn't sate your hunger or grant **Gluttony** stacks. You are however healed by 2 Vitality.

**Power Surge** 
Costs: 4PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 6
 Passive
 The instant heals you gain from reaching 5 stacks via the **Gluttony** cast or from casting **Instant Gratification** are increased by 2.

**Flesh becomes flesh** 
Costs: 6PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 6
Passive
While you have stacks of **Gluttony** you regenerate an extra point of Vitality each day.

**Gourmet** **of Phantoms**
Costs: 6PP, Requires [[BindingMastery:]] 7
Cast: Glow: 15, 1 Action
Consume a defeated [[Unbound]], [[Binding]] or a fallen enemy that had a Binding. You gain your [[Binding:BindingMastery|Mastery]] worth of **Gluttony** stacks and restore an equal amount of Vitality.
You have to roll checks for the first Mutation and Burn Table entry of the Binding you consumed(that you don't already have), these checks are one category **easier**, you add your half binding mastery value instead of the Binding ability bonus/malus for all required skill checks.
This is a very useful and much safer way to dispose of unwanted [[Unbound]]! The benefits are only short lasting tough.


=== Low Stability ===
**Spirit of Hunger**: Character requires 3 rations worth of meal each hour it is active. Not getting any of these rations causes 1 Stability damage. Character will do almost anything to get this food.
