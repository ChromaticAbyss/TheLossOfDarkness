====== KaelinsShard ======
Created Mittwoch 30 September 2015

Exists in physical form(crystalline) even as unbound. One special thing is that the **BindingMastery **in this Binding is limited. Each shard comes with a **power rating** thats usually around 1-3 which determines the maximum obtainable value.
However by killing an unbound of this type or creature with this binding the owner of this binding may add its **power rating** to their own. 
If you commit enough murders this is one of the most powerful bindings to have.


[[ProgressPoints|PP]]-cost on character generation: 20 (starts at 2 power rating)

=== Binding Process ===
**Special Rule: **Kaelin's Shard is actively trying to bind. No [[Abilities:Binding|Binding]] skill is required to initiate the process, however the -3 modifier to incompetent is applied in every roll! (Just because it wants to bind does not mean it doesn't try to change you)
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)

[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+0)  
**Eldritch Resonance**: -1 Glow Threshold, -1 modifier to the Cast ability.



[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
**Slipping Sanity**: You take a tenth of your [[Glow]] amount as damage to your Stability.
	

[[Binding|Amalgamation]]: Normal difficulty
