====== KaelinsShard ======
Created Mittwoch 30 September 2015

Exists in physical form(crystalline) even as unbound. One special thing is that the **BindingMastery **in this Binding is limited. Each shard comes with a **power rating** thats usually around 1-3 which determines the maximum obtainable value.
However by killing an unbound of this type or creature with this binding the owner of this binding may add its **power rating** to their own. 
If you commit enough murders this is one of the most powerful bindings to have.


[[ProgressPoints|PP]]-cost on character generation: 20 (starts at 2 power rating)

=== Binding Process ===
[[Binding|Stability]]: Normal difficulty (-0)
[[Binding|Mutation:]] Normal difficulty (+4)  
**Eldritch Resonance**: -1 Glow Threshold, -1 modifier to the Cast ability.

[[Binding|Burn Table:]] Normal difficulty (+0)
: You take a tenth of your [[Glow]] amount as damage to your Stability.

Ghastly Blaze - Adds Glow to a target that has a Binding

Reduce - Spell that is harder to resist and deals more damage the more Glow a target has

Spirit Blade - Creates a spectral copy of the shard that is able to deal Stun damage to an unbound on a successfull melee attack, deals 1D6 stun damage. Vs persons with a binding a triggered stun only make it impossible for them to use binding abilities.

Tether - Connects to a person with a Binding. Lasts X, max Range Y. While casting both characters gain half of the Glow of the spell. Can be cast on enemies but they can resist it.
