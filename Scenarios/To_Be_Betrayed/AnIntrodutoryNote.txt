As a token of his gratitude **Khonsu** shares with you that the self proclamined **Iden Kuras** of the frostspires will soon die on his quest to retrieve **The Bridge of Darkness**, the royal insignia and source of power of **Iden Yamah**. 
Aknowledging the tremedous industrial and military power of the **Red Lake Autonomy** **Iden Khonsu** would like to offer an alliance, the unique opportunity to sit among the rulers of the world instead of eternal servants.
The frozen spires and their riches are ripe for conquest and our combined power and knowledge will make short work of them. 
One of the leaders of your **Autonomy** will be expected to travel to the city of **Agnared**, chosen seat of the Iden and witness all of the **Idens** power and glory.
