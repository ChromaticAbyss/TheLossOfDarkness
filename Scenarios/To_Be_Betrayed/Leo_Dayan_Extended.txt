====== Leo Dayan Extended ======
Created Saturday 19 December 2015

This is an extension of [[World:Persons:Leo Dayan|Leo Dayan.]]

The following section describes in more detail the past and present of **Leo Dayan**.

During the crisis around the Iden Yamah and the Godless Three Leo was a [[World:Religions:Purity|Munditus]] in Oxygen city, a fanatic like they all are. His hatred for Iden Yamah was so intense that he called Kastav a "Bloody Traitor" as he announced the plan to make a deal with Iden Yamah. 
This got him 50 days in the deepest of cell of the Fortress. He was released on the day of the peace summit only to see the horizon drown in flame from the towers of the Cenotaph. After the chaos and terror of the following days had swept through the cities he heard about the godless three and dove 
deep into all kinds of scripture regarding conjuration and he even got hold of some other versions of the **Apocalypticum **which he stuided. 

=== Description ===
Middle aged man, wears a rugged grey munditus robe with the symbol of the [[World:Religions:Purity|Chapter of Purity,]] beneath that he wears mercenary armor. 
Lost both ears and a few fingers and toes to the frost. Has confusing lines tatooed all over his torso.

=== His story ===
"Me? If you had any contact with the Chapter of Purity recently which i assume you did since you recognized my robes you might know me as **Leo Dayan, the dissident**. I had quite the falling out with the chapter a decade ago and then decided to take the work of the divine into my own hands instead of idly waiting for it.

You want the full story? Fine i'll start at the beginning, back when i was a gullible little boy that tought the chapter was actually doing something which may have actually been true back in the day. While i was in the Cenotaph in The Fortress being trained as a Munditus the war between the tribes under Iden Yamah and our newly forged coalition of cities under Kastav slowly subsided. I called Kastav a 'goddamn idiot' or something for planning peace talks with that man that stood for everything we hated. For that i earned 50 days in the coldest and deepest cell of the entire Fortress. I had read the divine ward up and down so many times i feared my mind turning to goo when confusing news started dripping in. I remember somebody releasing me early to help prepare some urgent cermeonies and in the chaos of the following days i was completely forgotten.
The news of the deaths of Iden Yamah and Kastav and of the coup of the godless three hit me like a hammer. Back in that instance a Bloodline ruled by that abominable trio seemed like a very real possibility. I was out of town already moving to the military base when i heard that the Bloodline had dealt with those potential tyrant themselves already. 
The coming weeks i spent in San Te Kriin just trying to find out the facts you most likely know already, most imporantly that the godless three had the power of summoning which they used to annihalate everyone at the peace talks in a hope to take over the newly forming alliance.
I gathered books like a madman, everything i could find about conjuration. Books obscure and forbidden, heretic and confusing, I devoured them for years. It dawned on me that the conjurers of old are not a dieing out kin, that the world will not be bettered by simply murdering individual 
abominations. The problem we are facing must be solved at its roots. Its pointless to hunt unbound, mutants or even binders as long as people with their power still walked the land. Everyone with their abilities needs to be hunted down and killed, all of their knowledge and notes destroyed alongside the artifacts of old they use in their rituals.
The following years i spent in the archives, secretly destorying every single remains of the godless three to make it impossible for anyone and also speaking to the binders of the Bloodline cities gathering as much information about the actual enemy as humanly possible.
I had a long talk with a certain Giles Sa Vera which would a few years later come to fame and after that grabbed a bunch of likeminded mercenaries and set course upriver to go out and find the ancient hypertechnology that was crafted to fight the conjurers and the nightmares they unleash on the world. I roamed the world a long time to learn the most dreadful of truths: The ancient hypertechnology and the otherwoldly entities are one and the same. 
More and more i grasped control over these otherworldly forces until i became what i am now, an excorcist, hybrid of old technology and twisted flesh out to hunt every conjurer that still exists.
I sacrificed what humanity i still had to become the instrument of their downfall. 

I regret nothing."

=== What he does not tell about too openly ===
He made a few allies in the frozen spires during his stay in the frozen spires and his searches for the technology. One of them was the tribal priest [[World:Persons:Iden Kuras|Kuras]]. Together they created a large following with highly increased potential to fulfil their common mission. 
As Leo Dayan increased in power so did the influence of the [[World:Persons:Iden Kuras|Iden]]. Researching into the history of [[World:Persons:Iden Yamah|Iden Yamah]] they found out about an ancient piece of technology called the **Bridge of Darkness **and went to search and destroy it in the last place [[World:Persons:Iden Yamah|Yamah]] visited: The ash choked ravines 
that were burned by the pyroclasm for a decade, now known as the **valleys of spring**. However despite large effords the expedition was a disaster. Not only could the artifact not be found but also the harsh winter took a heavy toll among the men and claimed the life of [[World:Persons:Iden Kuras|Kuras]].
Leo and a few others were saved by the cartographers that were coming through a nearby road but Leo and Kuras followers quickly broke apart.
